1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:01,481
- [Instructor] In the last video,

2
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:03,872
we discussed why it took England

3
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:07,701
another 100 years to start colonizing

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:10,545
the New World after Christopher Columbus

5
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:13,254
first set foot in Hispaniola.

6
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:17,422
Among those reasons was conflict
within the United Kingdom,

7
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:20,727
colonial projects closer to home,

8
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,312
specifically Ireland,

9
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:25,979
and economic depression
that prevented England

10
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:29,185
from taking much time to
look outside its borders

11
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,105
to the broader world.

12
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:32,868
In this video, I'm gonna walk about

13
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:37,003
what led England to finally
get in the colonial game.

14
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,865
So what changes that allows England

15
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:41,316
to become a premier colonial empire

16
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:43,772
and go on to found what will be

17
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:45,664
the United States of America,

18
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:48,501
today even an English speaking country?

19
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,827
Well, some of these factors kind of

20
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:51,821
turn to their advantage.

21
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,424
Once the internal religious conflict

22
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,268
has been sorted out,

23
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:59,083
turning England into a Protestant nation,

24
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,442
they turn some of that animus outward

25
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:03,978
to Spain, a Catholic nation,

26
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:08,803
and they feel that they
have to compete with Spain

27
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:09,636
for riches

28
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,172
and for souls.

29
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:20,278
So certainly, the
Protestant nation of England

30
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:21,777
doesn't wanna be left behind

31
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,713
anymore than it already has been by Spain,

32
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:27,884
which has clearly been
reaping great riches

33
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:31,051
from the New World in the form of gold

34
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:36,143
down here in Mexico and Central America

35
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:38,560
and sugar, the Sugar Islands,

36
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,925
and they also don't wanna be one upped

37
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:45,118
by the Catholic nation of France,

38
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,868
which has been reaping
some excellent profits

39
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:52,410
trading with Native
Americans up in the region

40
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,954
which is today New York and Canada,

41
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:58,684
and they're getting furs.

42
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,808
So there's clearly a lot to be had

43
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:02,906
in the new world

44
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:07,399
and a lot of Catholics to
triumph over in having it.

45
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,847
Another thing that allows England to join

46
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,976
the imperial game in the New World

47
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:16,643
is the invention of the
Joint Stock Company.

48
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:24,221
Now, Joint Stock Companies
were kind of the precursor,

49
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,899
I mean, more than kind of the precursor,

50
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:30,066
really the precursor to
the modern day corporation,

51
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,835
and like modern day corporations,

52
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:35,091
what they did was kind of

53
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:38,547
spread both the riches and also the risk

54
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:42,331
of any kind of
entrepreneurial undertaking.

55
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,184
And what I mean by this is that

56
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:46,478
people could buy shares

57
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:48,803
in a Joint Stock Company,

58
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:50,872
and those shares were kind of divested

59
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,931
from your personal wealth.

60
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:55,156
So you could invest in something that,

61
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:56,500
if it went belly up,

62
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,053
wouldn't necessarily ruin you

63
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,817
'cause you just had a few shares.

64
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,015
So it's, you know, similar
to the stock market today,

65
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,874
a very early version of that.

66
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:07,492
So these Joint Stock Companies meant that

67
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:10,409
adventurers, people seeking wealth,

68
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:15,083
could go out to the
New World, for example,

69
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,867
with many different backers,

70
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,275
the risk spread across all of them,

71
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:22,859
and try to make profit
for their investors.

72
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,312
So many what we would call promoters

73
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:29,645
of the New World

74
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:36,006
tried to drum up interest in expeditions

75
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,246
to the New World.

76
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:40,580
Now, everybody knows that
Spain is making a killing

77
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,333
from gold and sugar,

78
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,055
and so they're saying, "Well,
maybe private individuals

79
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:48,144
"with the blessing,
though not the sponsorship

80
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,226
"of the crown can go to the New World

81
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:53,798
"and start extracting
some of these resources

82
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:56,408
"and start creating wealth
for their investors."

83
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:59,278
And so England issues several charters

84
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:02,049
to Joint Stock Companies that are still

85
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,300
familiar names to us today.

86
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,500
For example, the East India Company,

87
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,403
which Americans know best as the company

88
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:16,070
that supplied the tea
that Bostonians dumped

89
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:20,762
into Boston Harbor slightly
before the American Revolution,

90
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,858
but the one that plays the most role

91
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:25,470
in the early founding of the United States

92
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,470
is the Virginia Company,

93
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,484
and it's under the auspices
of the Virginia Company

94
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:36,056
that explorers like John
Smith head to Virginia

95
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:39,889
and Virginia is named
for Elizabeth the First,

96
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:42,725
Henry the Eighth's daughter,

97
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:45,300
who never married, and
therefore was said to be

98
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,765
the Virgin Queen,

99
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:50,282
so a new land named
after her was Virginia.

100
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,564
Now, we'll talk more
about the Virginia Company

101
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:53,655
in the next video,

102
00:04:53,655 --> 00:04:57,207
but the last thing I wanna
say about what prompted

103
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:01,671
England to join the imperial
game in the New World

104
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:06,299
was that England was having
a serious economic depression

105
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,132
and some real poverty.

106
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:14,426
Now remember that England
was a highly classed society

107
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:16,759
with aristocracy and gentry,

108
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,373
and these were inherited roles, right?

109
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,166
You couldn't rise

110
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,883
to be among these ranks, generally.

111
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:30,418
So, you know, about 95% of the population

112
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,984
didn't belong to either of these groups,

113
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,202
and a strong majority of those

114
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,145
were in dire poverty in the 1500s

115
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,548
and early 1600s,

116
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,474
and there were a number
of reasons for this.

117
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,424
The market for wool, which England,

118
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:49,257
being a major textile
producer, had collapsed,

119
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:54,224
so many people who had been

120
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:57,933
wool producers were in dire straits.

121
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:00,540
In fact, many of them were Puritans,

122
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,886
and we'll see more about
what happens to the Puritans

123
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:05,212
who leave England in another video,

124
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:08,348
and there's a process going
on in this time period

125
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,931
known as enclosure,

126
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:15,053
the Enclosure Movement.

127
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:18,536
And what enclosure meant is
kind of what it sounds like,

128
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,444
which is that early English towns

129
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:24,833
and manor houses were
kind of set up to have,

130
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,180
you know, the house.

131
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,012
That's the big manor house,

132
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:32,165
so just bear with me and imagine here,

133
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:35,165
and then they might have some forest

134
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,277
filled with a nice deer to hunt,

135
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:45,917
and then they might have
some nice fields, just grass,

136
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,428
and these were kind of
considered common lands.

137
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:54,753
So if you were a peasant, for example,

138
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:57,332
you might graze your cows

139
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,758
on these common lands.

140
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:01,397
You might go hunting in the forest.

141
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:03,495
Well, in this time period,

142
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:07,741
these great English lords
started to close off,

143
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:09,991
enclose these common lands.

144
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,598
So they'd fence them off.

145
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,901
This kind of makes
sense to our modern idea

146
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,954
of property holding, right?

147
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:23,721
It makes us understand who owns what thing

148
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,153
and how it gets deeded, et cetera,

149
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,789
but for very poor people,

150
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,337
this was a huge transition

151
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,305
because now they didn't have a place

152
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:34,623
to raise their livestock.

153
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:39,010
They didn't have a source
of hunting, protein,

154
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,018
so it made people who
were already on the edge

155
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,090
of poverty extremely poor.

156
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,746
It was a very difficult time

157
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:48,241
if you were already kind of living

158
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:52,002
in the foraging or small farming aspect

159
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,285
of English life.

160
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:57,697
And so, because of this Enclosure
Movement and depression,

161
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,697
crime rates are going up in England,

162
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,933
and this is a time when theft
is still a capital crime.

163
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:08,472
So if you're starving and
you steal something to eat,

164
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,104
you could be hanged,

165
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:12,993
and so many of the English gentry,

166
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,445
the people in Parliament,

167
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,641
are looking around and saying,

168
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:16,529
"Alright, what's going on?

169
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,565
"Are we having a moral crisis?"

170
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,454
Because they don't think in terms

171
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:22,137
that say, "Alright, many people are poor.

172
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:23,456
"Maybe they're going to steal."

173
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:25,585
Instead, they're saying,
"Why are people stealing?

174
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:26,863
"What's wrong with people?"

175
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:30,577
And so they think of this
as surplus population,

176
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,928
say there are too many people in England.

177
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:36,592
Now this is patently untrue

178
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,658
because there are way more people

179
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,139
living in London today

180
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:43,145
than there were in all of
England at that time period,

181
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,920
but the English Parliament,

182
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:47,297
sort of major thinkers in England,

183
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:50,094
start to think that there are
too many people in England.

184
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,639
There are just too many people

185
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,121
for having enough stuff to go around,

186
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,789
and so they start wondering.

187
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,769
Maybe these people should go elsewhere.

188
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,352
Maybe they should go to colonies

189
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:02,708
where maybe they can buy more goods,

190
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,901
produce more raw materials,

191
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:08,636
and find a different place
in the social structure

192
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:10,243
and economy of England,

193
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,839
and that starts to come true

194
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,635
when the Virginia Company
sets off for Jamestown,

195
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,968
which they'll reach in 1607,

196
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,591
and we'll talk about
that in the next video.
