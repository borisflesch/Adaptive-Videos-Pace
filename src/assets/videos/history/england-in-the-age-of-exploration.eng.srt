1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,421
- [Instructor] I think
there's a strong argument

2
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:02,926
to be made that England was the most

3
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:06,176
powerful and successful imperial nation

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:11,032
of all time, but when you look back to the

5
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:14,661
Age of Exploration, it
becomes clear that England

6
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:19,029
was actually pretty late
to the imperial game.

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,364
As we know, Christopher Columbus,

8
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:24,203
backed by Spain, had arrived in

9
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:27,203
Hispaniola in the New World in 1492.

10
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:33,346
He was the first European to start

11
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:36,366
a colony in the New World.

12
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:39,793
England, by contrast, didn't actually have

13
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:42,695
a successful colonial venture in the

14
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:45,695
New World until 1607 with Jamestown.

15
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:50,220
Now from this distance it doesn't look

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,220
that far behind, but this
is more than 100 years

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,723
later than Spain's
first colonial ventures.

18
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:01,893
So what was England up to?

19
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:05,407
Why were they so late
in the colonial game?

20
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,264
That's what I'd like to
take a closer look at

21
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:08,994
in this video, and I'll also talk

22
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,460
a little bit more about what conditions

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,627
in England led that nation
to start New World colonies.

24
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,073
Now I think the biggest reason why England

25
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:22,833
waited another 100 years to have a

26
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,154
New World colony is that England had

27
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:26,993
its own problems, and it had a number

28
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:28,954
of problems in this time period,

29
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:32,571
and we're talking about the 1500s here.

30
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:35,695
And the first of these
was ongoing conflict

31
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,085
between Catholics and
Protestants in England.

32
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:41,038
Now this is a very long story.

33
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,188
I don't have time to
do justice to it here,

34
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,412
but suffice it to say
that the trouble started

35
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:49,204
with Henry VIII, who we know from his

36
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:51,940
many wives and many beheadings,

37
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,417
and Henry VIII broke away
from the Catholic Church

38
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,662
in Rome to start his own church,

39
00:01:57,662 --> 00:02:00,592
the Church of England, also
known as the Anglican Church.

40
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:02,513
Now this is a Protestant religion.

41
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:05,573
I'm gonna put P here for Protestant.

42
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:08,739
Now Henry had two daughters, Elizabeth

43
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:12,961
who like him was a Protestant,

44
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:18,210
and Mary, who was a
Catholic, and Mary occupied

45
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:21,536
the throne for a number of years,

46
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:24,181
but Elizabeth managed to
wrest it away from her

47
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,207
and once Elizabeth was on the throne

48
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:31,374
as Elizabeth I, England
became a Protestant nation.

49
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:37,623
So it's hard to be
involved in world affairs

50
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,392
when you've got kind of
a crisis of succession

51
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:44,559
going on, so one factor
here is religious conflict.

52
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,736
Another reason why England is not headed

53
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:54,679
over to the New World is that they have

54
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:58,664
colonial problems closer
to home in Ireland.

55
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:02,099
England is trying to, and will succeed at,

56
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,432
subduing Ireland as one of its colonies,

57
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:10,168
and they're undertaking a very bloody

58
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,877
and costly war, and they think of this

59
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:16,158
Catholic Irish population almost as

60
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,462
barbarian savages who don't know

61
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:21,286
what's good for them and in
the opinion of the English,

62
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,915
what's good for them is English rule

63
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:24,572
and Protestantism, when of course

64
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,666
what the Irish really want is self rule

65
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,496
and to be left alone, but they use

66
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:32,433
very brutal tactics against the Irish,

67
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,619
and we'll kind of see that again

68
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:37,284
when they're met with another hostile

69
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,456
colonial population in North America.

70
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:42,296
Another issue England is dealing with

71
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:44,213
is economic depression.

72
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:47,556
The Crown doesn't have a lot of money

73
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:50,277
and there's a great deal of crime

74
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:53,178
and poverty throughout the nation,

75
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,897
so while the Crown can't actually afford

76
00:03:56,897 --> 00:04:00,400
to sponsor colonial exploits the way

77
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,450
that Spain sponsored Columbus, they still

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,700
managed to get some riches out

79
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,195
of the New World by giving ship captains

80
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,862
license to plunder Spanish ships

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,931
coming back with New World riches,

82
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,185
and these were called privateers,

83
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:20,601
the most famous of them here is this man,

84
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:25,919
Sir Francis Drake, and
really, privateers are

85
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,893
just pirates with a fancy name,

86
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,931
but the logic here was, why bother

87
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:35,264
trying to set up a colony here in Mexico

88
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:39,260
or South America, the West Indies,

89
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,848
and do all the work of setting up housing

90
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,846
and trying to tame laborers and mining,

91
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,357
when instead you could just let the

92
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:52,116
Spanish do all of that and then put that

93
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:55,949
gold on a ship and then
use your awesome navy,

94
00:04:57,261 --> 00:05:00,981
'cause England is growing
a very awesome navy,

95
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,814
to steal those riches.

96
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,706
So England doesn't have a strong incentive

97
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:10,348
to do all the labor when they can

98
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:13,664
just steal it from the
ships along the way.

99
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:14,902
Alright, those are some of the reasons

100
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:17,572
why it took England so long to start

101
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,892
colonization in North America.

102
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:21,436
In the next video I'll talk about

103
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:24,765
the factors that led England to finally

104
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:27,003
join the race for New World colonies.
