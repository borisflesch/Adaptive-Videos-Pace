00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,369
- [Narrator] In the
last video we discussed

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,864
how the Portuguese began to really expand

3
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:08,494
their exploration around Africa

4
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:10,891
with the invention of the caravel,

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:14,388
a fast new ship that
could sail into the wind,

6
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:18,428
and how Spain, newly united
with Ferdinand and Isabella,

7
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:23,369
completed its campaign to
expel Muslims from Spain,

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,247
the Reconquista, in 1492
and began to look outward

9
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:31,527
for an opportunity to
compete with Portugal.

10
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:34,265
And it was into that
moment that they received

11
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:36,828
an interesting proposal
from this man here,

12
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,299
Christopher Columbus.

13
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,028
So who was Christopher Columbus?

14
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:41,910
Well, he was a navigator.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,410
He was born around 1451 we think in Genoa,

16
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:49,378
which is today in Italy.

17
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,878
And he had sailed quite a bit in his life.

18
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:57,218
He was also a voracious
reader thanks to the invention

19
00:00:57,218 --> 00:01:00,087
of the printing press back in 1450.

20
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,329
And one book that he
read with great interest

21
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:07,263
was the account of Marco Polo
and his travels in China.

22
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:10,851
And Columbus dreamt of getting to China

23
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:14,518
and there accessing
riches, silk and spices,

24
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:20,112
and maybe even converting
people living in Asia

25
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:23,529
to Christianity, and teaming up with them

26
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:31,550
in a new crusade to expel
Muslims from the Middle East.

27
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,835
Now there are two common
myths about Columbus

28
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:35,327
that I'd like to dispel.

29
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,253
One of these is that Columbus
was the first European

30
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:41,336
to discover the Americas.

31
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:47,431
In fact we know that around 1000 CE

32
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:55,157
the vikings of Norway
had colonized Greenland

33
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:00,523
and had explored around
what is today Canada.

34
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:06,340
So you might be asking,
"Okay, well if the vikings

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,449
"discovered America, why
aren't we talking about

36
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,468
"the vikings in this video?"

37
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:14,402
And the short answer is
the viking settlement

38
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,452
in the Americas did not last very long,

39
00:02:17,453 --> 00:02:19,345
less than a generation.

40
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:23,921
And it also didn't really get
well known outside of Norway,

41
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:28,362
so it didn't have the worldwide
impact on colonization

42
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:31,664
that Columbus's voyage would have.

43
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:34,547
The other myth about
Columbus is that he was

44
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:38,941
the lone visionary who knew
that the world was round.

45
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,946
Everybody else thought
that the world was flat

46
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,493
and Columbus proved them wrong.

47
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:49,421
In fact most learned people
had known that the world

48
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:52,656
was round since the time
of the ancient Greeks.

49
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:55,678
What they thought instead
was that the world was simply

50
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:56,888
too big.

51
00:02:56,888 --> 00:03:01,080
They estimated that it
was about 25,000 miles

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,111
in circumference, which is
pretty close to the truth,

53
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:09,470
and that even if you could
sail out here into the ocean,

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,143
you would run out of
supplies and die long before

55
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:16,251
you ever hit land 'cause they had no idea

56
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:18,439
that the Americas were over here.

57
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,315
Columbus however had done
some different calculations

58
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:23,437
and he thought that the
circumference of the world

59
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,270
was only about 16 to 18,000 miles.

60
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:34,441
So that the coast of Japan
was about 3,000 miles

61
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,777
to the west of Europe.

62
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,821
Now he was wrong, but he
got very lucky because

63
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,526
about 3,000 miles to the west of Europe

64
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:48,221
he encountered landfall.

65
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,284
He just didn't know that what
he found there wasn't China.

66
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:54,088
So Columbus has this dream
and he kind of shops it around

67
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:57,191
the courts of Europe
looking for royal patronage.

68
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:01,146
And first he tries the
Portuguese because they are

69
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:03,576
the reigning leaders of navigation.

70
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,995
And they turn him down
saying his idea is too risky.

71
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,940
He also tries France and
England with similar results.

72
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,298
Finally he tries Spain.

73
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:15,673
And Ferdinand and Isabella
agree that they will stake him.

74
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,589
They give him three ships
and a crew of 87 men.

75
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:23,700
And in August of 1492 he takes off,

76
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,217
makes a brief stop in the Canary Islands,

77
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:33,373
and then turns west into open waters.

78
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,046
And in October of 1492 he made landfall,

79
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:38,455
and this is what he found.

80
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:42,210
So he landed on the small island
that he named San Salvador

81
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:44,711
which is today in the Bahamas.

82
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:50,359
And then he continued to
explore around the coast of Cuba

83
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,008
that he called Juana.

84
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:56,224
And then he ended up in the
island that he called Hispianola

85
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:59,057
which is today the island of Haiti

86
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,201
and the Dominican Republic.

87
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:06,777
And we'll talk more about
who he met in the new world

88
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:07,869
in the next video.
