00:00:00,416 --> 00:00:01,432
- [Instructor] Although we tend to think

2
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:05,563
about Christopher Columbus'
first voyage in 1492,

3
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:09,297
transforming the history of the Americas,

4
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:12,195
it actually transformed a
great deal more than that,

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,164
and in this video I want to talk

6
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:18,287
about the larger world historical process

7
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,634
that Columbus' voyage opened up,

8
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:23,212
that transformed not only the Americas,

9
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:26,765
but also Europe and
Africa, and this was called

10
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,948
the Columbian Exchange.

11
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:31,478
So what was the Columbian Exchange?

12
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:34,311
This was a process of transferring

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,233
plants,

14
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:41,894
animals,

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,683
microbes

16
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,077
and people

17
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,286
across the Atlantic in both directions.

18
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,542
And not just trading these goods,

19
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:58,060
but transplanting them
from Europe and Africa

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,233
into the Americas and
the other way around.

21
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,940
And some of these exchanges
of species were intentional,

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,857
like bringing new crops
to grow in environments

23
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:09,672
that were suited to them, and some of them

24
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:13,229
were unintentional, like
the microbes and pests,

25
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,304
which were like little
hitchhikers on the bodies

26
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:18,682
and crops that Europeans
brought to the New World.

27
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:22,349
And it had a tremendous
environmental affect

28
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:27,345
that had real consequences

29
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:34,087
for people on both sides of the Atlantic.

30
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,980
So let's look a little bit
closer at some of the things

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,706
that were exchanged across the Atlantic

32
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:43,590
after Columbus began the process

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,576
of bringing things from the
Old World to the New World,

34
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:50,678
and from the New World to the Old World.

35
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:54,378
So first let's take a
closer look at the plants.

36
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,766
Now, Spain, much like Portugal, was hoping

37
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,805
to use this tropical
landscape to grow cash crops.

38
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:04,555
So Columbus brought with
him sugar and grapes

39
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:09,673
for wine, and coffee, these were all crops

40
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:12,770
that would fetch high prices in Europe.

41
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,937
It was so lucrative to
grow sugar in the Caribbean

42
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,505
that they didn't even
want to give up any space

43
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,495
to grow food, they imported their food

44
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:27,336
so that they could spend all
of their land growing sugar.

45
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:30,338
The Europeans also brought New World crops

46
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:32,561
back to the Old World,
and some of these it's

47
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:36,257
almost impossible to
imagine a world before,

48
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,605
for example, the tomato
had ever come to Europe.

49
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,697
Can you imagine Italian
food with no tomato sauce?

50
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:46,358
They also brought corn and potatoes

51
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,858
and sweet potatoes and cassava, or manioc.

52
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,370
And what's important about
most of these crops is

53
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,370
that they're very calorically dense.

54
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:03,129
So if you grew a field of potatoes,

55
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:08,325
instead of a field of
wheat, which might be

56
00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:12,209
a typical crop grown in the
Old Word before contact,

57
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,460
you can feed three times as many people

58
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:21,208
with a field of potatoes
than you can with wheat.

59
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,031
So what does this cause?

60
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:27,390
It causes a real increase
in population in Europe.

61
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,837
It also causes an increase
in population in Africa,

62
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:34,667
where manioc is a crop
that was frequently grown

63
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,163
and also very calorically dense.

64
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:39,893
So New World foods
helped Europe and Africa

65
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:42,344
increase their populations.

66
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:44,137
So what about these animals?

67
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:47,969
The Europeans brought cattle, sheep,

68
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,136
pigs, and horses to the New
World, with mixed results.

69
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:58,042
Horses, for example, were
a tremendous technology

70
00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:01,169
that was widely adopted throughout Mexico

71
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,840
and the Native Americans
living in the Great Plains

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,262
of what is today the United States found

73
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:10,230
that horses revolutionized
their ability to hunt.

74
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,929
So that was a great step up for them.

75
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,777
The pigs they brought over, however,

76
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:18,219
weren't so great because
Europeans allowed the pigs

77
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:22,069
to roam freely, which meant
that they ate everything,

78
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,242
including the Native Americans' crops,

79
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:28,160
and they multiplied very quickly.

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,098
So they became kind of
a pest in the New World.

81
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:35,577
Probably the thing that
had the biggest affect

82
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:39,310
in the Columbian Exchange was the transfer

83
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,560
of Old World diseases to the New World.

84
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,582
With Europeans came smallpox, measles,

85
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,345
whooping cough, and the Native Americans

86
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:55,228
had very little immunity
to these diseases.

87
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,228
It's estimated that within 100 years

88
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:03,242
of Columbus landing in Hispaniola,

89
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:07,333
90% of all people who were living

90
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:11,823
in the Americas died of disease.

91
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:18,868
This is a demographic catastrophe

92
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,751
the likes of which the
world has never seen

93
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,084
before or since.

94
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:27,961
And most of the Native
Americans who were affected

95
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,680
by these diseases would never
have actually interacted

96
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,430
with a European, they
just had trade networks

97
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,484
that spread these diseases back and forth

98
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,986
throughout the Americas.

99
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,972
Now, you might be wondering, okay,

100
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:48,642
so if the Native Americans
were being exposed

101
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,849
to new diseases from the Europeans,

102
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,991
weren't the Europeans also being exposed

103
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:56,561
to new diseases from the Native Americans?

104
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,991
Why didn't it have such
a strong impact on them?

105
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:01,639
There are a couple of reasons for that.

106
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,407
One is that there was a
greater population density

107
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,358
in Europe and Africa,
there were more people

108
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:14,249
and they lived closer together in cities.

109
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,214
So this gave diseases
opportunities to bounce

110
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:19,801
back and forth between people and evolve

111
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,676
and become stronger.

112
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:25,744
The other important thing
is that Europeans lived

113
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,161
close to animals,

114
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,726
and as we remember from
things like bird flu

115
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,436
or swine flu, animals and
humans can pass diseases

116
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,320
back and forth between each other,

117
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,650
and that makes those
diseases even stronger.

118
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,155
In comparison, Native
Americans didn't have much

119
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:47,775
population density and they
only domesticated dogs.

120
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:51,801
And dogs, unlike pigs, can't
pass that many diseases

121
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,070
back and forth between humans.

122
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:57,485
So Native Americans just
didn't have diseases

123
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,315
that were as vicious as the diseases

124
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:03,271
that had been passed from person to person

125
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:07,345
for many thousands of
years in Europe and Africa.

126
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,134
So this gets to the last aspect
of the Columbian Exchange,

127
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,350
the exchange of people.

128
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,130
Very quickly after Europeans arrived,

129
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,738
the Native American population suffered

130
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,738
from tremendous outbreak of disease,

131
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,083
which meant that although
the Europeans had hoped

132
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:32,405
to enslave them and use
them as a labor force

133
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:35,912
in these Caribbean plantations,
very few of them survived,

134
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:39,584
which meant that the Europeans
needed another labor force.

135
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,343
They found that labor source
on the West Coast of Africa,

136
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:47,596
where there was a long
tradition of slave trading,

137
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:51,783
and they brought enslaved
African people against their will

138
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:56,120
across the Atlantic to
work in the Caribbean,

139
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,407
so that very quickly a
majority of the population

140
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:03,740
in the Caribbean was of African descent.

141
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,222
Ironically, this population
explosion brought on

142
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:12,239
by New World foods meant
that there were more people

143
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,614
in Africa who were possible
subjects to enslavement,

144
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:18,846
and it helped them keep
their population numbers

145
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:22,096
relatively steady despite the exodus of

146
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:25,776
as many as 12 to 13 million people

147
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:31,635
over the course of the years
between Columbus arriving

148
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,552
and approximately 1800.

149
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:37,972
Likewise, this population
explosion in Europe led

150
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:40,554
to worries about overpopulation

151
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,185
in the 1600s and 1700s.

152
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:49,202
And what did the nations of Europe do?

153
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:52,723
They began sending people
over to the colonies.

154
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:55,447
So the contact and exchange initiated

155
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:58,720
by Christopher Columbus when he connected

156
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,470
the Old World with the
New had a profound affect

157
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,528
on the environment, not
just of the New World,

158
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,524
but of the Old World as well.

159
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:11,912
And this profound affect on
the whole benefited Europe,

160
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:15,662
at the expense of the
Americas and of Africa.
