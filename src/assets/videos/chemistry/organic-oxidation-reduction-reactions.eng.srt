1
00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:02,820
- Now that we know how to
assign oxidation states

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,685
to Carbon let's look at some
organic redox reactions,

3
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:09,740
and remember these definition
from general chemistry.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,461
Oxidation involves an increase
in the oxidation state

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,796
and reduction involves a decrease

6
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:20,742
or a reduction in the oxidation state.

7
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:25,239
You might also remember that
loss of electrons is oxidation

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,501
and gain of electrons is reduction.

9
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:33,098
So, LEO the lion goes GER as
a good way to remember that.

10
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:35,466
Let's look at this starting compound here

11
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:37,242
and this reaction, and let's figure out

12
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,574
whether the starting compound

13
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:41,804
has been oxidized, reduced, or neither.

14
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:44,476
If you look at these
three carbons on the left

15
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:47,144
and these three carbons on the right.

16
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:49,236
All right, there's no
change to those carbons

17
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:50,419
so there should be no change

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,136
in the oxidation states of those carbons

19
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,342
but when you look at
this carbon right here,

20
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:57,675
the one I just marked in yellow, right,

21
00:00:57,675 --> 00:00:59,404
on the left it's bonded to,

22
00:00:59,404 --> 00:00:59,864
let me go ahead and draw

23
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:03,125
that out, Is double bonded to an oxygen,

24
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,581
and on the right it's
bonded to a hydrogen,

25
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:08,959
and on the left it's bonded to a carbon.

26
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,064
But on the right here
that same carbon, right,

27
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:14,243
is now bonded to an oxygen on the right.

28
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:17,402
So, it still double bonded it to an oxygen

29
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:20,049
and has a, has a bond
to a carbon on the left,

30
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,846
but on the right now,
it has a bond to an OH.

31
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:27,688
So, that carbon has likely
changed its oxidation state

32
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,661
and we can go ahead and
find the oxidation state

33
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:33,190
using what we learned in the last video.

34
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,523
So, remember you need to put
in your bonding electrons.

35
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:38,821
So, let's put in our
bonding electrons here.

36
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,327
Each bond consists of two electrons.

37
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:45,638
All right, so we know that when
we're doing oxidation states

38
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,772
we need to think about
electronegativity differences

39
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:51,873
and carbon is more
electronegative than hydrogen.

40
00:01:51,873 --> 00:01:55,352
So, we assign both of
those electrons to carbon.

41
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:58,153
Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon

42
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:00,591
so oxygen takes all
four of those electrons.

43
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,657
And when we get to carbon versus carbon

44
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:04,272
we can assume that those carbons have

45
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:06,198
the same electronegativies

46
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:08,216
and therefore for two electrons

47
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:10,306
we're gonna split those two electrons up.

48
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,549
We're gonna give one
electron to one carbon

49
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,871
and the other electron
to the other carbon.

50
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,994
So, this carbon is
surrounded by three electrons

51
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:19,980
and we know carbon should have,

52
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,509
we know carbon is supposed to have

53
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,135
a number of four valence
electrons around it.

54
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:25,796
So, carbon's supposed to have four.

55
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:28,847
In our dot structure here
Carbon only has three.

56
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,089
Let me highlight them.
One, two, and three.

57
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:35,234
So, four minus three gives us plus one

58
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,008
which is the oxidation
state for this carbon.

59
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,830
So, this carbon right here
has an oxidation state

60
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,672
of plus one on the left.

61
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:44,150
What about on the right?

62
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,751
Let's go ahead and put in
our bonding electrons, right.

63
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:51,455
So, we know that each bond
consists of two electrons.

64
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,057
Let me put those in here.

65
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:55,911
And again, we think
about electronegativity.

66
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,406
This time on the right, this carbon

67
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:01,656
is bonded to an oxygen now so carbon loses

68
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,967
those two electrons to oxygen.

69
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,151
Right, oxygen's more electronegative.

70
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,609
Oxygen takes, this top oxygen
takes those four electrons

71
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,212
and again, we split these two electrons.

72
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,228
So, this time carbon is
only surrounded by one.

73
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,527
So, define carbon's oxidation state

74
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,850
we know that carbon's supposed

75
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,370
to have four valence electrons

76
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:22,311
and from that we subtract the number

77
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:24,153
of valence electrons around carbon

78
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,823
once we've accounted
for electronegativity.

79
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,846
And that's only one electron now.

80
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:31,030
So, four minus one gives us

81
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,093
an oxidation state of plus three.

82
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,554
So, on the right this same carbon

83
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:40,180
now has an oxidation state of plus three.

84
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,129
So, what happened in this reaction?

85
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,852
Carbon went from an
oxidation state of plus one

86
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,608
to an oxidation state of plus three.

87
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:52,193
An increase in the oxidation
state is oxidation.

88
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:55,434
So, our starting compound
was oxidized here.

89
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,953
So, our starting compound was oxidized.

90
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:00,890
In order for this to be oxidized

91
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,928
we would need some sort
of oxidizing agent.

92
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,194
So, I'll write that down
here really quickly.

93
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:07,714
We would need an oxidizing agent

94
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,712
to accomplish this reaction.

95
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:12,209
And it's the oxidizing agent that itself

96
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,196
is being reduced because remember,

97
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:15,752
whenever something is being oxidized

98
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:18,267
something else has to be reduced.

99
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,924
Let's think about the
other definitions for,

100
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,992
the other definition I
should say for oxidation.

101
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:28,705
We know that oxidation
involves the loss of electrons.

102
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,993
So, let's look at that here.

103
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:33,793
On the left, right, carbon
had three electrons around it,

104
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:36,996
and when we added a bond to oxygen,

105
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:40,406
right, carbon lost these
two electrons over here.

106
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,615
It had those two electrons.

107
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,172
On the left it had those two electrons.

108
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:45,250
On the right it lost those two electrons

109
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,025
and now it's only surrounded by one.

110
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:50,370
And we see an increase
in the oxidation state.

111
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,111
So, it's like carbon lost electrons.

112
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:56,455
Also there's a shortcut that you can use.

113
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,693
For this reaction, let's think about

114
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,097
what that shortcut would be.

115
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:02,316
Let me use, I'll use red still.

116
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:05,614
On the left, this carbon with
an oxidation state of plus one

117
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,388
has two bonds to oxygen.

118
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,818
Let me go ahead and highlight them here.

119
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,801
So, here's one bond and
here's the other bond.

120
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:13,089
On the right, that same carbon now

121
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,065
has three bonds to oxygen.

122
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,408
So, here's one bond, here's two bonds,

123
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,150
and then this bond over here.

124
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,746
So, we've increased in the
number of bonds to oxygen

125
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:25,965
and that can tell us we have
an oxidation really quickly

126
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:29,017
without going through and doing
all these oxidation states.

127
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:31,966
Notice we lost a bond to hydrogen.

128
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,925
All right, so over here we
lost this bond to hydrogen

129
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:39,744
and we replaced it with a bond to oxygen.

130
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:42,005
So, an increase in the
number of bonds to oxygen

131
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:45,026
or a decrease in number
of bonds to hydrogen

132
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:49,409
can tell you that your
carbon is oxidized too.

133
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,205
Let's do another one.

134
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:51,507
So, our goal is to figure out

135
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:53,245
whether this starting compound has

136
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:56,021
been oxidized, reduced, or neither.

137
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,784
So, again, these three
carbons on the left, right,

138
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:01,082
are the same as these
three carbons on the right.

139
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,883
And there's no change in those carbons.

140
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:04,566
So, therefore we would expect no change

141
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:05,984
in the oxidation state.

142
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,325
The same with this carbon.

143
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,043
So, we're gonna focus in on this carbon.

144
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,866
So, on the left that
carbon has a double bond

145
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,909
to oxygen so we draw that in there

146
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,906
an then it's bonded to
a carbon on the left

147
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:19,125
and a carbon on the right.

148
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,747
And our product, that same carbon,

149
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,326
is now bonded to only one oxygen.

150
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:25,868
Let me go ahead and do that.

151
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,784
Only one bond I should say to oxygen

152
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:30,197
and it's still bonded
to a carbon on the left

153
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,881
and still bonded to a carbon on the right,

154
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,820
and it must have a bond to
hydrogen in here, right?

155
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,526
It's not drawn in but it's
assumed that you know that.

156
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,664
So, let's put in that bond to hydrogen.

157
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,957
And let's find our oxidation states.

158
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,479
So, we start on the left,

159
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,243
and we draw in our bonding electrons,

160
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:50,782
and next we think about
electronegativity differences.

161
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:54,221
So, we know that oxygen's more
electronegative than carbon

162
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,541
so oxygen takes those four electrons.

163
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,805
Over here, right, we assume
that the electronegativities

164
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:01,544
for these carbons are the same,

165
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,159
and so we split up those two electrons.

166
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,063
We give on electron to one carbon

167
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,084
and one electron to the other carbon.

168
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,558
And same over here.

169
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,986
So, the oxidation state for carbon

170
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,839
would be four valence electrons

171
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,525
minus this, in this case we have

172
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:16,582
two around carbon, so here's two.

173
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:20,736
Four minus two gives us an
oxidation state of plus two.

174
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:22,800
So, on the left this carbon has

175
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,881
an oxidation state of plus two.

176
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:26,599
What about on the right?

177
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,318
Let's put in our bonding electrons

178
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:30,834
and again, once we've
done that we think about

179
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,901
electronegativity and we can assign

180
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,882
an oxidation state to that carbon.

181
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:39,602
So, we know that oxygen's
more elecrtonegative

182
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,679
so oxygen takes those two electrons.

183
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,815
Right, again, there's, we assume

184
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:46,518
that these carbons have
the same electronegativity

185
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,101
so we split up those electrons.

186
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,504
We split up these electrons.

187
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:52,001
But now carbon is bonded to hydrogen.

188
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,729
So, carbon is a little
more electronegative

189
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,332
than hydrogen so we just give both

190
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,685
of those electrons to carbon.

191
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:01,233
And now let's find our oxidation state.

192
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,948
We know carbon is supposed to have

193
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:04,885
four valence electrons around it

194
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,606
and in our drawing here, once we've

195
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:08,568
accounted for electronegativity

196
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:12,828
carbon is surrounded by
one, two, three, and four.

197
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:16,902
So, four minus four is equal to zero.

198
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:19,051
And so this carbon, this carbon now

199
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,803
has an oxidation state of zero.

200
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,892
So, that carbon went
from an oxidation state

201
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:27,001
of plus two to an oxidation state of zero.

202
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:30,102
That's a decrease in the oxidation state.

203
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:32,727
So, carbon was reduced.

204
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:36,883
So, in this reaction our
starting compound was reduced.

205
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,900
All right, so this was, our
starting compound was reduced

206
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,988
which means we would need
some sort of reducing agent

207
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,960
to accomplish this reaction.

208
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,444
And it's the reducing agent
that would be oxidized

209
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,770
because if something is reduced

210
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,942
something else has to be oxidized.

211
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:56,329
We can also think about our
other definition for reduction.

212
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,569
Gain of electrons is reduction

213
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,507
and let's look at what happened here.

214
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,444
So, the electrons that were gained right,

215
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:05,687
were these two electrons right here

216
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,566
because on the left we had this carbon

217
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,229
with a double bond to this oxygen.

218
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,946
On the right, we have only
now one bond to oxygen.

219
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,046
Right, so we gained these two electrons

220
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:17,204
because we increased the
number of bonds to hydrogen.

221
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:19,045
So, our other shortcut is to look

222
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:21,568
at the number of bonds to oxygen.

223
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:23,566
Like we talked about in the last example.

224
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:26,639
On the left, carbon has
a double bond to oxygen.

225
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,566
So, two bonds to oxygen.

226
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,181
On the right we have
only one bond to oxygen.

227
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:34,130
So, we decreased in the
number of bonds to oxygen

228
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,929
so that's a reduction.

229
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:37,867
Again, a fast way of figuring it out.

230
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:41,135
Or we increased an number
of bonds to hydrogen.

231
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:45,763
Let's do one more of these problems.

232
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:46,878
So, our goal is to figure out

233
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,596
if our starting compound on the left

234
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:51,335
has been oxidized, reduced, or neither.

235
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:53,297
And this time these are the two carbons

236
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:55,017
that we are going to analyze.

237
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,530
Those are the two carbons

238
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,389
that have changed in this reaction.

239
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,712
So, on the left let's draw what we have.

240
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:03,732
We have a carbon with a
double bond to another carbon

241
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:06,488
and both of those carbons are bonded to,

242
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:09,146
directly bonded to two more carbons.

243
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,282
On the right, those carbons now

244
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,384
only have a single bond between them

245
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:15,220
and this carbon on the left

246
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,682
is bonded to a hydrogen.

247
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,409
This carbon on the right is
directly bonded to an oxygen

248
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:21,814
and let's put in those
other carbons, right?

249
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,507
We have another carbon, carbon bonds.

250
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,574
I mean, let's put in those
carbon, carbon bonds like that.

251
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,324
Let's assign our oxidation states.

252
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:31,126
So, we draw in our bonding electrons

253
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:35,329
and we think about
electronegativity differences

254
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:37,752
but we're going assume once again

255
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:41,909
that our carbons have the same
electronegativity on the left

256
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,652
and so when we're assigning electrons

257
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,728
let's just pick one of those carbons.

258
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,472
So, let's pick the carbon
on the left, right?

259
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:51,119
We divide up those two
electrons in that bond.

260
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,869
Give one electron to one carbon.

261
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,135
One electron to the other.

262
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,412
We do the same thing here.

263
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:57,210
And for the double bond
with four electrons

264
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,952
we divide up those four electrons.

265
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,693
We give two electrons to each carbon.

266
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:04,353
And so carbon is supposed to
have four valence electrons

267
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:09,248
and around it, this carbon
has one, two, three, and four.

268
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:13,232
So, four minus four is an
oxidation state of zero.

269
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:16,877
So, this carbon has an
oxidation state of zero.

270
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,911
Same thing for the carbon on the

271
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,976
right side of the double bond, right?

272
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:22,476
So, the same situation.

273
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:25,877
So, it also has an
oxidation state of zero.

274
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:28,058
What about for our product, right?

275
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,891
Let's examine those two carbons.

276
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,771
Let's put in our bonding electrons.

277
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,906
So, we draw in our bonding electrons here.

278
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,315
So, we put those in.

279
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,214
A lot more bonding electrons to draw.

280
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:41,272
And we think about electronegativity
differences, right?

281
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:42,930
Things have changed.

282
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,771
So, now, now let's focus in
on the carbon on the left.

283
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:50,266
So, the carbon on the left
is now bonded to a hydrogen

284
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,751
and carbon is a little
bit more electronegative.

285
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:55,074
So, we give both of
those electrons to carbon

286
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,475
and then we have carbon bonded to carbon,

287
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,287
carbon bonded to carbon,
and carbon bonded to carbon.

288
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,713
So, what's the oxidation state

289
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,906
of that carbon on the left now?

290
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:06,113
Carbon is supposed to have
four valence electrons

291
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:07,855
and how many do have around it?

292
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:11,631
Let's see, one, two, three, four, five.

293
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,348
So, four minus five gives us

294
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,413
an oxidation state of minus one.

295
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,652
So, this carbon on the left now has

296
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,985
an oxidation state of minus one.

297
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:23,191
What about the carbon on the right?

298
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:25,269
Well, we have a tie here, right?

299
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,290
So, we divide up those
electrons, a tie here,

300
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,834
but oxygen is more
electronegative than carbon.

301
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,188
So, oxygen gets both of those electrons.

302
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:33,847
So, the carbon on the right should have

303
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:37,191
an oxidation state of for minus three.

304
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,665
Here are the three electrons around carbon

305
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:42,031
once we've accounted
for electronegativity.

306
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:46,192
So, that's an oxidation state of plus one.

307
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,975
So, this carbon has an
oxidation state of plus one.

308
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,973
So, overall, what happened here?

309
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:51,142
Well, let me use red.

310
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:53,628
So, the carbon on the left went from

311
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:55,311
an oxidation state of zero

312
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:58,642
to an oxidation state of minus one.

313
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:01,708
That is a decrease in the oxidation state.

314
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,447
So, that carbon was reduced.

315
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,412
What about the carbon on the right side

316
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,324
of the double bond that
we started off with?

317
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:10,692
It started off with an
oxidation state of zero

318
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:13,828
and it went to an oxidation
state of plus one.

319
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:16,545
That's an increase in the oxidation state.

320
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,564
So, that carbon was oxidized.

321
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,722
What can we say about
starting compounds overall?

322
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,405
Well, the starting compound overall

323
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:26,947
there's no net change in
the oxidation states, right?

324
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,525
So, on the left for those two carbons

325
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,964
we get a total of zero.

326
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:32,402
On the right we had negative
one and positive one

327
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:33,586
for a total of zero.

328
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:35,049
There's no net change.

329
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,709
So, this would be neither.

330
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,673
The starting compound was, overall,

331
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:42,256
it wasn't oxidized or
reduced. It's neither.
