1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:02,263
Voiceover: Sometimes one
dot structures is not enough

2
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:04,593
to completely describe
a molecule or an ion,

3
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:07,645
sometimes you need two or
more, and here's an example:

4
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:11,545
This is the acetate anion,
and this dot structure

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,229
does not completely
describe the acetate anion;

6
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:18,003
we need to draw another
resonance structure.

7
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,745
And so, what we're gonna
do, is take a lone pair

8
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:22,494
of electrons from this
oxygen, and move that lone

9
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:25,811
pair of electrons in here,
to form a double-bond

10
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:28,778
between this carbon and that oxygen.

11
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,679
And at the same time,
we're gonna take these two

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,836
pi electrons here, and move
those pi electrons out,

13
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:37,262
onto the top oxygen.

14
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:40,061
So let's go ahead and draw a resonance,

15
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:42,863
double-headed arrow here,
and when you're drawing

16
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:45,777
resonance structures, you
usually put in brackets.

17
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:46,879
And let's go ahead and draw

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,979
the other resonance structure.

19
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,346
So now, there would be a double-bond

20
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,546
between this carbon and this oxygen here.

21
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:56,294
This oxygen on the
bottom right used to have

22
00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:58,912
three lone pairs of electrons around it,

23
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:01,077
now it only has two, because one of those

24
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:04,629
lone pairs moved in, to form that pi bond.

25
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:08,244
The oxygen on the top used
to have a double-bond,

26
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:11,463
now it has only a single-bond
to it; and it used to have

27
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,845
two lone pairs of
electrons, and now it has

28
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,544
three lone pairs of electrons.

29
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,295
That gives the top oxygen a
negative-one formal charge,

30
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,629
and make sure you
understand formal charges,

31
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,679
before you get into drawing
resonance structures,

32
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:28,346
so it's extremely important
to understand that.

33
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:31,629
All right, so next, let's
follow those electrons,

34
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,879
just to make sure we
know what happened here.

35
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,144
So, these electrons in
magenta moved in here,

36
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:42,797
to form our pi bond, like
that, and the electrons

37
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:48,130
over here, in blue, moved
out, onto the top oxygen,

38
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,012
so let's say those electrons in blue are

39
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:52,479
are these electrons, like that.

40
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,846
So, we have two resonance structures

41
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:57,811
for the acetate anion,
and neither of these

42
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:01,728
structures completely
describes the acetate anion;

43
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:04,711
we need to draw a hybrid of these two.

44
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:07,062
And so, if we take a look
at, let's say the oxygen

45
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:09,794
on the bottom-right here, we
can see there's a single-bond

46
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:12,712
between this carbon and this oxygen.

47
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:14,345
If we look at this one over here, we see

48
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:15,529
there is now a double-bond

49
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,295
between that carbon and the oxygen.

50
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:19,779
So, if you think about
a hybrid of these two

51
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,612
resonance structures, let's go ahead

52
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:24,381
and draw it in here, we
can't just draw a single-bond

53
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,379
between the carbon and that oxygen;

54
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,161
there's some partial,
double-bond character there.

55
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,977
So, it's a hybrid of the
two structures above,

56
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:33,810
so let's go ahead and draw

57
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,212
in a partial bond here, like that.

58
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:39,713
The exact same thing for the top oxygen:

59
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:42,346
Here we have a double-bond,
and then over here

60
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:46,114
we have a single-bond,
so somewhere in between

61
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:48,061
is going to be our hybrid.

62
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,430
So let's go ahead and draw that in.

63
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,263
So, we can't just draw a
single-bond in our hybrid;

64
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:54,879
we have to show some partial,
double-bond character,

65
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,143
drawing the dotted line
in there, like that.

66
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,504
And also charge, so if
we think about charge,

67
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,477
the negative charge is on the oxygen

68
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:06,754
on the bottom-right, and then over here

69
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,095
the negative charge is on the top oxygen.

70
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:13,645
And, so that negative charge
is actually de-localized,

71
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:15,712
so it's not localized to one oxygen;

72
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,095
it's de-localized, it's
distributed evenly,

73
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,262
over both of those oxygens, here.

74
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:24,546
And so this is just one way
to represent the hybrid, here,

75
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:27,155
and studies have shown that the hybrid

76
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:30,146
is closer to what the
actual anion looks like.

77
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,078
So, studies have been
done on these bond lengths

78
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:38,993
here, and the bond between
this carbon and this oxygen,

79
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,629
it turns out to be the
exact same bond length

80
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,504
as the bond between the
carbon and this oxygen,

81
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,712
so, it's the exact same bond length.

82
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:47,095
And so, the hybrid,
again, is a better picture

83
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:50,792
of what the anion actually looks like.

84
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,543
Let's think about what
would happen if we just

85
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:56,596
moved the electrons in magenta in.

86
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:57,912
So if I go back to the very first thing

87
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,461
I talked about, and you're
like, "Well, why didn't

88
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:02,077
"we just stop, after moving
these electrons in magenta?"

89
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,929
Let's go ahead and draw
what we would have,

90
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,189
if we stopped after moving
in the electrons in magenta.

91
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,227
So we would have this, so
the electrons in magenta

92
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,273
moved in here, to form our double-bond,

93
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:18,389
and if we don't push off
those electrons in blue,

94
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,822
this might be our resonance
structure; the problem

95
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:23,699
with this one, is, of course the fact

96
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,631
that this carbon here
has five bonds to it:

97
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:30,662
So, one, two, three,
four, five; so five bonds,

98
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,482
so 10 electrons around it.

99
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,810
We know that carbon can't exceed the octet

100
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,215
of electrons, because of its position

101
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:41,116
on the periodic table, so
this is not a valid structure,

102
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:43,248
and so, this is one of
the patterns that we're

103
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:45,796
gonna be talking about in the next video.

104
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,881
So the pattern is, a
lone pair of electrons,

105
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:52,582
so next to a pi bond, which is the example

106
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:55,497
we see here for the acetate anion, and so

107
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,033
these are the two resonance structures.

108
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,165
The problem with the
word, "resonance," is,

109
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,449
when you're a student,
you might think that

110
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,998
the anion will resonate back and forth

111
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,832
between this one and this one; that's

112
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:09,235
just kind of what the name seems to imply.

113
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:11,233
And that's not actually what's happening;

114
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:13,398
it's just that we can't
draw, if we're just

115
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,232
drawing one dot structure, this is not

116
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,333
an accurate description,
and so the electrons

117
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,631
are actually de-localized,
so it's not resonating

118
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,965
back and forth.

119
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:23,097
When you draw resonance
structures in your head,

120
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:25,948
think about what that
means for the hybrid,

121
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,998
and how the resonance
structures would contribute

122
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,981
to the overall hybrid.

123
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,549
So don't forget about
your brackets, and your

124
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:36,767
double-headed arrows, and
also your formal charges,

125
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:37,882
so you have to put those in,

126
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:40,115
when you're drawing your
resonance structures.

127
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:44,766
All right, let's look at an
application of the acetate anion

128
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,666
here, and the resonance
structures that we can draw.

129
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,865
If we look at the
acetate anion, so we just

130
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:53,858
talked about the fact that one of these

131
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,582
lone pairs here, so this is
not localized to the oxygen;

132
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:58,931
it's de-localized, so we
can move those electrons

133
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:01,599
in here, we push those
electrons off, onto the oxygen,

134
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,515
we can draw a resonance structure, and so

135
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:05,865
this negative-one formal
charge is not localized

136
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,583
to this oxygen; it's de-localized.

137
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,374
And so, because we can
spread out some of that

138
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:15,748
negative charge, that
increases the stability

139
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:20,916
of the anion here, so
this is relatively stable,

140
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,997
so increased stability,
due to de-localization.

141
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:26,747
So, the fact that we can draw

142
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:29,615
an extra resonance structure,
means that the anion

143
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,816
has been stabilized.

144
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:34,866
And so, this is called,
"pushing electrons,"

145
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,983
so we're moving electrons
around, and it's extremely

146
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:40,380
important to feel comfortable
with moving electrons

147
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,714
around, and being able to follow them.

148
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:46,787
So, the only way to get
good at this is to do

149
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:49,232
a lot of practice problems,
so please do that;

150
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,315
do lots of practice
problems in your textbook.

151
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:55,282
If we compare that to the ethoxide anion,

152
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,733
so over here, if we try
to do the same thing,

153
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,565
if we try to take a lone pair of electrons

154
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:03,215
on this oxygen, and move it into here,

155
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,066
we can't do that, because
this carbon right here,

156
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:08,830
already has four bonds;
so it's already bonded

157
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:12,233
to two hydrogens, and then we
have this bond, and this bond.

158
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,316
And so, moving those
electrons in, trying to

159
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,614
de-localize those electrons, would give us

160
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,832
five bonds to carbon,
and so we can't do that;

161
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:20,913
we can't draw a resonance structure

162
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:22,631
for the ethoxide anion.

163
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:25,398
So those electrons are
localized to this oxygen,

164
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,965
and so this oxygen has a full,
negative-one formal charge,

165
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,765
and since we can't spread
out that negative charge,

166
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,330
or it's going to destabilize this anion.

167
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,663
So this is not as stable,
so decreased stability,

168
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:41,149
compared to the anion on the left, because

169
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:43,782
we can't draw a resonance structure.

170
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:48,329
If we think about the
conjugate acids to these

171
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,315
bases, so the conjugate
acid to the acetate anion

172
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,282
would be, of course, acetic acid.

173
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:56,366
So we go ahead, and draw
in acetic acid, like that.

174
00:07:56,366 --> 00:08:01,147
The conjugate acid to the ethoxide anion

175
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,664
would, of course, be ethanol.

176
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,831
So we go ahead, and draw in ethanol.

177
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:07,932
And we think about which
one of those is more acidic.

178
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:10,733
We know that acetic acid is more acidic;

179
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,815
it's more likely to donate a proton,

180
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,698
because the conjugate base is more stable,

181
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:18,015
because, you could think about resonance,

182
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:21,080
or de-localization of electrons.

183
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,666
If you're looking at
ethanol, ethanol's not

184
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,498
as likely to donate its proton,

185
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:27,982
because the conjugate
base, the ethoxide anion

186
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:30,033
is not as stable, because you can't draw

187
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,783
any resonance structures for it.

188
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,664
The negative charge is not
able to be de-localized;

189
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:36,997
it's localized to that oxygen.

190
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,614
So this is just one
application of thinking

191
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:40,730
about resonance structures, and, again,

192
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,398
do lots of practice.

193
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,048
In the next video, we'll
talk about different

194
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:46,869
patterns that you can
look for, and we talked

195
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:49,399
about one in this video:
We took a lone pair

196
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,951
of electrons, so right here
in green, and we noticed

197
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,815
this lone pair of electrons
was next to a pi bond,

198
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,198
and so we were able to draw

199
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,399
another resonance structure for it.

200
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,733
We don't have that
situation with ethoxide:

201
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,746
We have a lone pair of electrons,

202
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:08,081
but we don't have a pi bond next to it,

203
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,156
And so, more in the next video on that.
