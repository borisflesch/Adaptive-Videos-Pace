00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:01,101
- [Voiceover] In this video,

2
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,482
we're going to find the oxidation state

3
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:05,222
of carbon in several different molecules.

4
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:06,871
In earlier video, we've already seen

5
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:09,215
the definition for oxidation state,

6
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:11,966
and also how to calculate it.

7
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:13,546
So let's start with methane,

8
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,090
and let's find the oxidation state

9
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,854
of carbon and methane.

10
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:19,328
One approach is more of a
general chemistry approach

11
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:21,951
where we know that hydrogen usually has

12
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,331
an oxidation state of plus one,

13
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:28,267
and we have four hydrogens
for a total of plus four.

14
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,090
The sum has to be equal to zero,

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,609
so we know that carbon's oxidation state

16
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,209
must be minus four immediately,

17
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,810
since we only have one carbon here.

18
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,006
So let's go ahead and verify that

19
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,805
with our dot structure.

20
00:00:40,805 --> 00:00:43,011
So remember, when we're calculating

21
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:45,646
the oxidation state using dot structures,

22
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,666
we're thinking about bonding electrons,

23
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,372
and we know that each bond consists

24
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:51,010
of two electrons, so we need

25
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,949
to put in the bonding electrons

26
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,629
for all of our bonds.

27
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,626
Next, we think about the oxidation state

28
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,248
for carbon, and we start with a number

29
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,687
of valence electrons in the free atom,

30
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,289
or the number of valence electrons

31
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:07,553
that carbon is supposed to have,

32
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,131
and we know carbon is supposed to have

33
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:11,442
four valence electrons,

34
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:13,809
so from that number,
we subtract the number

35
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,423
of valence electrons in the bonded atom,

36
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,002
or the number of valence electrons

37
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,845
carbon has in our drawing.

38
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,806
But now we need to think
about these covalent bonds

39
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:27,509
as being ionic, and so
the more electronegative

40
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,470
atom is going to take all of the electrons

41
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,525
in the bond, so we need to think

42
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,265
about electronegativity differences,

43
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,889
and we're comparing carbon to hydrogen.

44
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,720
So which is more electronegative?

45
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:43,461
We know that carbon is
more electronegative

46
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:46,491
than hydrogen, so the two electrons

47
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,348
in this bond here, carbon is going

48
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:51,402
to take both of them, so
it's winner takes all.

49
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,722
Carbon's going to hog those
electrons in this bond.

50
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:57,286
All right, same for this
next carbon-hydrogen bond.

51
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,902
Carbon is more electronegative,

52
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,666
so it takes those electrons,

53
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,801
and all the way around.

54
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:05,449
So we can see that
carbon is now surrounded

55
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:08,699
by eight electrons right,
let's count them up here,

56
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,926
one, two, three, four, five,

57
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:17,523
six, seven, eight, so four minus eight

58
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:21,029
is equal to minus four, so we already knew

59
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:23,862
that minus four was going
to be the oxidation state

60
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,567
for carbon.

61
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,028
Let's move on to another molecule here,

62
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:32,999
so C2H4, this is ethene, or ethylene.

63
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,807
What's the oxidation state of carbon

64
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,084
in this molecule?

65
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,128
Well hydrogen should be plus one,

66
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:42,843
and we have four of them
for a total of plus four.

67
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,606
So the total for carbon
should be minus four,

68
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:47,777
because that total has to sum to zero,

69
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,262
but this time we have two carbons,

70
00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:52,467
so minus four divided by two

71
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:55,787
gives us minus two,
each carbon should have

72
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:58,864
an oxidation state of minus two.

73
00:02:58,864 --> 00:02:59,979
And let's verify that,

74
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,185
let's put in our bonding electrons,

75
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:05,238
and let's calculate the oxidation state

76
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:08,500
of carbon by using our
little formula here.

77
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,323
So you put in our bonding electrons,

78
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,517
and let's just pick one of the carbons

79
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:13,886
to start off with, let's say we're talking

80
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:16,243
about the carbon on the right.

81
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:19,158
So we think about
electronegativity differences,

82
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,001
and we know carbon is more
electronegative than hydrogen,

83
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,345
so carbon's going to
steal those electrons,

84
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,402
and same thing over here,

85
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:28,061
carbon's more electronegative,

86
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,779
so carbon steals those electrons too.

87
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,566
When we get to this double bond here

88
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:36,151
between the two carbons, we
have these four electrons,

89
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,708
and now we're trying to
compare the electronegativity

90
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,191
of carbon, to carbon, and obviously,

91
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,315
that's the same electronegativity.

92
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,669
So with four electrons,

93
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:48,072
we're going to divide
those electrons equally,

94
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:49,372
because both of those carbons

95
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:52,414
have the same value for
the electronegativity

96
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:53,923
and so we take those four electrons,

97
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:55,108
we divide them in half,

98
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,988
so we give two electrons to one carbon

99
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:59,566
and two electrons to the other carbon.

100
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:02,932
So carbon normally has
four valence electrons,

101
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,626
right, so we're using our formula here

102
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,951
for oxidation state.

103
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,948
Oxidation state is equal to the number

104
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,492
of valence electrons that carbon

105
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,813
is supposed to have, minus the number

106
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:13,914
of valence electrons around carbon

107
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:16,051
in our drawings, so let's count them up

108
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,743
after we've accounted
for electronegativity.

109
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:22,332
That's one, two, three, four,

110
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:25,815
five, and six, so four minus six

111
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,195
gives us an oxidation state for carbon

112
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:30,493
of minus two, which is in agreement

113
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,780
with what we calculated over here.

114
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,255
Keep in mind that each carbon

115
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:35,996
was supposed to have an oxidation state

116
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:38,097
of minus two, so if we look over here

117
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:39,897
at the carbon on the left,

118
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:42,299
and we just assign those
electrons really quickly,

119
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,412
we can see that that would
be the same caluclation,

120
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:46,410
four minus six gives us minus two,

121
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,974
so each carbon has an
oxidation state of minus two.

122
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:52,354
We move on to another molecule,

123
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:56,591
so CH2O, this is formaldehyde,

124
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,110
and we know that oxygen usually has

125
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,537
an oxidation state of minus two,

126
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,534
and we have one oxygen for a total

127
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,275
of minus two down here.

128
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,515
Hydrogen usually has an oxidation state

129
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,292
of plus one, and we have two of them

130
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,917
for plus two.

131
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,832
This total has to sum to zero,

132
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,050
so carbon should have an oxidation state

133
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,254
of zero in this molecule.

134
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,076
And let's go ahead and
look at the dot structure.

135
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:23,478
We put in all of our bonding electrons,

136
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:26,393
so we can find the oxidation state easier,

137
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,515
and we think about
electronegativity differences.

138
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,139
We know carbon's more
electronegative than hydrogen

139
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,440
so carbon takes those electrons.

140
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,424
Same for this bond, carbon
takes those electrons.

141
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,395
But now, now we're going to compare carbon

142
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:44,970
to oxygen, and we know oxygen
is more electronegative

143
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,536
than carbon, so oxygen's going to take

144
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,997
all of those electrons, so all four

145
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:52,656
of those electrons in that double bond.

146
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,012
So it's winner takes all
when you're thinking about

147
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:56,893
oxidation states.

148
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,238
So because oxygen is more electronegative,

149
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:01,293
it takes all of those electrons,

150
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:03,220
and now we can see that
carbon is surrounded

151
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,552
by four electrons, so one, two,

152
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,292
three, four, carbon is supposed

153
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,090
to have four valence electrons around it,

154
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,655
and here we see it is surrounded by four

155
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:17,453
and once we take into
account electronegativity,

156
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:20,575
so four minus four gives
us an oxidation state

157
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:24,477
of zero, so in the formaldehyde molecule,

158
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:27,089
carbon has an oxidation state of zero,

159
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,969
which is what we predicted over here.

160
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,397
Let's think about oxygen.

161
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:33,335
We said that oxygen would
have an oxidation state

162
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:36,330
of minus two, so let's look at oxygen,

163
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,570
oxygen is right here.

164
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,067
Let's think about how
many valence electrons

165
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,087
oxygen should have.

166
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,896
Well, because of it's position
on the periodic table,

167
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,554
oxygen should have six valence electrons.

168
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,272
How many electrons are around it now,

169
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:53,837
once we've accounted
for electronegativity?

170
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:57,587
Well, here's one, two, three, four,

171
00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:01,034
five, six, seven, and eight.

172
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:04,147
So six minus eight gives
us an oxidation state

173
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:06,852
for oxygen of minus two.

174
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:09,207
What about for hydrogen?

175
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:13,806
So hydrogen should have
one valence electron,

176
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:16,267
but there's zero electrons around it here

177
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,786
because carbon's more
electronegative than hydrogen,

178
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:21,770
so one minus zero gives
us an oxidation state

179
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,450
of plus one, which is what
we predicted over here,

180
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,551
and the same thing for this hydrogen.

181
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:31,474
So this formula works for other atoms too.

182
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:34,435
All right, let's do another example,

183
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,873
and this time we're doing formic acid,

184
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,873
so CH2O2, oxygen should be minus two,

185
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:43,563
and we have two of them,

186
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,604
so we have minus four
for totaling our oxygens.

187
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:48,264
Hydrogen should be plus one,

188
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:51,945
and we have two of them
for a total of plus two,

189
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:54,126
and now, this total has
to (mumbles) equal zero.

190
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:56,563
So we know that carbon's oxidation state

191
00:07:56,563 --> 00:08:01,103
should be plus two in the
formic acid molecule here.

192
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:05,003
So let's go over and put
in our bonding electrons,

193
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:07,721
so we put in all of our
bonding electrons here,

194
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:11,703
and we think about the
oxidation state of carbon,

195
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:14,301
we think about electronegativities.

196
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:16,857
So carbon is more
electronegative than hydrogen,

197
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:19,759
so carbon gets those two
electrons in that bond,

198
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,174
but over here, oxygen
is more electronegative

199
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:25,181
than carbon, so oxygen
takes those electrons,

200
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,561
and the same thing above,

201
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:28,420
oxygen is more
electronegative than carbon,

202
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,835
so oxygen takes those electrons too.

203
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:33,284
So what's the oxidation state of carbon

204
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,082
in formic acid?

205
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,044
Well, carbon is supposed to
have four valence electrons,

206
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,761
and from that we subtract the number

207
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,560
of electrons around carbon,

208
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,640
once we've accounted
for electronegativity.

209
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,438
Once we pretend like everything is ionic,

210
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,760
and that's only two electrons this time,

211
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,801
so four minus two gives
us an oxidation state

212
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,041
for carbon of plus two,
just like we predicted

213
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,259
over here.

214
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,372
So you can see every molecule we've done

215
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,659
so far, has had a
different oxidation state

216
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,258
for carbon, carbon is unique,

217
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,522
it has all these different
oxidation states.

218
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:09,866
Let's finally look at carbon dioxide.

219
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,664
So oxygen should have an oxidation state

220
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:15,310
of minus two, and we have two of them

221
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,064
for a total of minus four,

222
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,408
so carbon must have an oxidation state

223
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:22,450
of plus four, so we look
at our dot structure

224
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,047
over here, and we put in
our bonding electrons,

225
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:29,404
and we think about electronegativity.

226
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:32,423
Oxygen is more
electronegative than carbon,

227
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:34,327
so oxygen is going to steal --

228
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,266
each oxygen is going
to steal the electrons

229
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,612
in those bonds.

230
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:38,831
Let me re-draw it here.

231
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:41,766
I'll show oxygen with all these electrons

232
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:43,719
around it so the four electrons

233
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,159
in that double bond here,

234
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,877
are all going to be on
this oxygen on the left.

235
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:50,257
Same thing for the oxygen on the right.

236
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,637
It has these lone pairs of electrons,

237
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,577
and it's more electronegative than carbon,

238
00:09:53,577 --> 00:09:55,736
so it steals all of those electrons,

239
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:58,174
which leaves carbon with zero electrons

240
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:01,853
around it, so to find
carbon's oxidation state,

241
00:10:01,854 --> 00:10:03,839
we know carbon should have four

242
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,309
valence electrons, and here,

243
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,874
we have zero electrons around carbon.

244
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,788
So four minus zero gives
us an oxidation state

245
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:15,433
of plus four, just as we predicted,

246
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:17,851
and if you wanted to do each oxygen,

247
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,929
oxygen should have six valence electrons,

248
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,564
and here we have one, two, three,

249
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:26,885
four, five, six, seven, eight,

250
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:29,788
so six minus eight gives us minus two

251
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:32,771
for the oxidation state of oxygen.

252
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,070
All right, let's go back up to

253
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:35,523
the beginning here.

254
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,427
Let's look at all these
different oxidation states

255
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,342
that we covered for carbon.

256
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:41,564
So we started off with an oxidation state

257
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,475
for carbon of minus four,

258
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,297
we went to minus two, and then we went

259
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:49,570
to zero, and then we went to plus two,

260
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,948
and then finally, we
ended up with plus four.

261
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:55,967
So carbon can have a
range of oxidation states,

262
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:58,451
from minus four to plus four,

263
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:01,516
when you're talking about
carbon with four bonds.

264
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:03,049
And you can also have in between, right,

265
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,834
it's possible, of course,
for carbon to have

266
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,146
an oxidation state of plus three,

267
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:08,434
I just didn't do an example

268
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,452
like that in this video.
