1
00:00:00,685 --> 00:00:01,660
- [Voiceover] We've already seen

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,833
that formal charge is equal

3
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,690
to the number of valence electrons

4
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,095
in the free atom, minus the number

5
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:08,452
of valence electrons in the bonded atom,

6
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:09,589
and another way of saying that

7
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,633
is the formal charge is equal to

8
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,373
the number of valence electrons the atom

9
00:00:13,374 --> 00:00:15,452
is supposed to have, minus the number

10
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:18,238
of valence electrons the atom actually has

11
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:20,630
in the drawing, so let's
assign a formal charge

12
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,509
to oxygen in this molecule.

13
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:26,701
Remember that each bond is made up

14
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,914
of two electrons, so this bond right here

15
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:30,458
is made up of two electrons.

16
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,498
This bond over here is
made up of two electrons,

17
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,380
and our goal is to find the formal charge

18
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,098
on oxygen, so the formal charge

19
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:39,220
on oxygen is equal to the number

20
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,134
of valence electrons in the free atom,

21
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:43,268
so the number of valence electrons

22
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,135
that oxygen is supposed to have,

23
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:46,970
we know that's six, right, oxygen

24
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,873
is supposed to have six valence electrons,

25
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,476
minus the number of electrons

26
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:53,958
that oxygen actually has in our drawing.

27
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,317
Now remember when you have a bond

28
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:57,279
with two electrons, we give one electron

29
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,276
to one atom, and the other electron

30
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,414
to the other atom.

31
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:01,737
So from these two electrons,

32
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:04,257
oxygen gets one of those electrons.

33
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:05,859
All right, same thing
for this other bond here,

34
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,622
oxygen gets one of those electrons,

35
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,876
and the other electron goes to hydrogen.

36
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:13,579
So now we have a total of six electrons

37
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,981
around our oxygens, so
I'll highlight those.

38
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:19,419
We have one, two, three, four,

39
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:22,018
five, six, so there are six

40
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:24,236
valence electrons around the oxygen

41
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:26,872
in our drawing, so six minus six

42
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:30,239
is equal to zero, so the formal charge

43
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,093
on oxygen is equal to zero.

44
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,032
And let me go ahead and
write down this pattern

45
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,304
that we've just seen.

46
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:41,542
When oxygen has two bonds,

47
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:45,582
and two lone pairs

48
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:47,857
of electrons, one oxygen has two bonds

49
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,646
and two lone pairs of electrons,

50
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:54,208
the formal charge is equal to zero.

51
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,762
And sometimes, the lone
pairs are just left off

52
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:58,562
for convenience reasons, right,

53
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:01,464
so you could draw this with your oxygen,

54
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:02,926
and your hydrogen like that,

55
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:04,819
or you could even go like this,

56
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,746
and all those are just different ways

57
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:09,103
of representing the same molecule.

58
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,878
So leaving off lone pairs of electrons.

59
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:13,480
Let's look at some other examples,

60
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,965
where the formal charge on oxygen

61
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:17,079
is equal to zero,

62
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,761
and we'll look at the
one on the left first,

63
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,339
so the formal charge is equal to zero

64
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:24,323
on this oxygen and we can see we have

65
00:02:24,323 --> 00:02:26,343
two bonds here to oxygen, here's one

66
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:28,281
of the bonds to oxygen,
and here's the other bond

67
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,141
to oxygen.

68
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:30,417
The lone pairs of electrons

69
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:32,403
have been left off this dot structure,

70
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,703
but we know, since the
formal charge is zero,

71
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:35,898
we already have our two bonds here.

72
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,045
There should be two pairs of electrons

73
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:41,131
on that oxygen, so you
can put them in there

74
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:42,328
or you could leave them off.

75
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,208
I'll go ahead and put them in.

76
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,251
So we have a total of eight electrons

77
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,864
around our oxygen, so oxygen's following

78
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:51,209
the octet rule here,
so I'll highlight them,

79
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,202
two, four, six, and eight.

80
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:56,863
On the right, we have another example,

81
00:02:56,863 --> 00:02:59,788
where oxygen has a formal charge of zero,

82
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,646
and this oxygen has two bonds to it

83
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:04,606
so here's one of the bonds,
and here's the other bond,

84
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:05,847
and this oxygen would also have to have

85
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:08,066
two lone pairs of electrons on it,

86
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,551
and again, I didn't draw them in here.

87
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,129
Sometimes you don't draw
them in here for convenience,

88
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,766
but I could go ahead and add them,

89
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,227
so it's easier to see that that oxygen

90
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:18,734
has a formal charge of zero.

91
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:21,370
And a total of an octet
of electrons around it,

92
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,647
so let me highlight those,

93
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:25,769
two, four, six, and eight.

94
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,326
So these patterns are important,

95
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:29,950
and for oxygen, two
bonds, and two lone pairs

96
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,452
of electrons give us a
formal charge of zero.

97
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:36,636
Let's move on to another formal charge

98
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:39,411
situation for oxygen, let's
find the formal charge

99
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:42,835
on oxygen here, so we start by drawing in

100
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:44,981
the electrons in our bonds.

101
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,420
Each bond consists of two electrons,

102
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,823
so I draw those in.

103
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,576
What is the formal charge
on oxygen this time?

104
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,525
So the formal charge is equal to

105
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,256
the number of valence electrons oxygen

106
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,926
is supposed to have, which is six,

107
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,480
minus the number of valence electrons

108
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,614
oxygen actually has in our drawing.

109
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,785
So we divide up our electrons again,

110
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,561
so oxygen gets one from this bond,

111
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:09,362
and one from this bond,

112
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,882
and one from this bond,

113
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:14,400
so how many electrons
are around oxygen now?

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,918
This would be one, two, three,

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,077
four, and five.

116
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:24,918
So six minus five is equal to plus one,

117
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,482
so it's like oxygen has
lost an electron here.

118
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:31,802
So oxygen has a formal charge of plus one.

119
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:33,718
I could re-draw that, let me go ahead

120
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:34,856
and do that over here.

121
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,435
So I could re-draw that over here,

122
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,870
so we have oxygen with
our bond to hydrogens,

123
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,065
and oxygen has a lone pair of electrons

124
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:45,827
on it, and this oxygen has
a plus one formal charge.

125
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,288
And so we can come up
with another pattern here.

126
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,889
Here oxygen has three bonds,

127
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,596
let me highlight those bonds.

128
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,081
I'll use red this time,

129
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,554
so here's one bond, two bonds,

130
00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,840
and then three bonds
and then one lone pair

131
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,659
of electrons, so the
pattern of three bonds

132
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:07,361
plus one lone pair of electrons

133
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,520
for oxygen will give you a formal charge

134
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,412
of plus one, and again,

135
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,038
it's good to recognize these patterns.

136
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,873
You should be able to do the calculation,

137
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,776
and then after you do
enough of these problems,

138
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,599
you can just look at it and figure out

139
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,619
what the formal charge is.

140
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:22,699
Let's look at some more examples

141
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,916
where oxygen has a formal charge

142
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,820
of plus one,

143
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,956
and the lone pairs were left off

144
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,557
of this one, again, for
convenience reasons,

145
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:33,380
so we'll start with this example

146
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,957
on the left, we can see that the oxygen

147
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,536
with a plus one formal charge

148
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,940
has three bonds to it.

149
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,784
Here's one, here's two,
and then here's three,

150
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,619
so three bonds, in order for that oxygen

151
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,163
to have a plus one formal charge,

152
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:47,021
it must also have one lone pair

153
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,818
of electrons on it, so you
could just leave them off

154
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:50,887
and know that they're there,

155
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,570
or you could go ahead and draw them in,

156
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,869
and I'll draw them in on that oxygen.

157
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:57,875
Now to our other example over here

158
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,175
on the right.

159
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,869
This is the oxygen with
a plus one formal charge,

160
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:04,168
so that oxygen must have three bonds

161
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,189
and one lone pair.

162
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,432
So here are the three bonds,

163
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,229
here's one, two, and three,

164
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,366
and again, I didn't draw in the lone pair

165
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,712
of electrons on the oxygen,

166
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,136
but the lone pair is there,

167
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:17,039
so I'll go ahead and put it in like that.

168
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,199
So recognize this pattern,

169
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,020
three bonds, plus one
lone pair for oxygen,

170
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,037
gives us a formal charge of plus one.

171
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,873
You could have also figured out

172
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:28,137
how many electrons are necessary.

173
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,471
Let's use this example, by,

174
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,759
let me go ahead and re-draw it here.

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,315
So how else could we figure out

176
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,496
how many electrons are on that oxygen,

177
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,397
if that oxygen has a
plus one formal charge.

178
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,466
Well you could say that, all right,

179
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,103
the calculation for formal charge

180
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:46,352
would be six minus x
is what we don't know,

181
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,489
but we do know the formal
charge is plus one,

182
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,647
so let me just put this
in a little box over here.

183
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:53,666
So six minus x is equal to plus one.

184
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,743
Obviously, x would have
to be equal to five,

185
00:06:56,743 --> 00:07:00,040
meaning that oxygen
would have five electrons

186
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,524
around it, let's think about how many

187
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,205
electrons we see right now around oxygens.

188
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:08,039
So let me draw in some electrons here

189
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,604
and I'll use red, so this bond

190
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,881
is two electrons, and then we have

191
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,866
a bunch of electrons in here,

192
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,399
so how many electrons around oxygen

193
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,141
do we have so far?

194
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,706
Well, we would have three,

195
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,342
just these three, and we need five,

196
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,804
which means we need two more,

197
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:26,335
which means we need a
lone pair of electrons

198
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,681
on the oxygen.

199
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:31,276
So that's a little bit too complicated,

200
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,430
I think, for figuring it out,

201
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,928
but you could use that method,

202
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:36,053
or you could just learn
this pattern, right,

203
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,794
and eventually, you'll
have to have this pattern

204
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,454
down pretty well.

205
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:41,230
Let's look at another example

206
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,168
for assigning formal charge to oxygen.

207
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:45,572
So our goal is to find the formal charge

208
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,894
on oxygen in this example,

209
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:50,436
and we put in our electrons in this bond.

210
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,037
Each bond represents two electrons,

211
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,126
so the formal charge on oxygen,

212
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,878
is equal to the number
of valence electrons

213
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,514
that oxygen is supposed
to have which is six,

214
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,359
minus the number of valence electrons

215
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,541
that oxygen actually has,

216
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,517
and in this example, right,

217
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,933
we would take one of these electrons

218
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,860
from this bond, and how many electrons

219
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,136
is that total around oxygen?

220
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:13,795
This would be one, two, three,

221
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:16,453
four, five, six, seven,

222
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,239
so six minus seven
gives us a formal charge

223
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,631
of negative one.

224
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,592
So I could re-draw that over here,

225
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,635
I could say oxygen has three lone pairs

226
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,572
of electrons, and a negative one

227
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:32,799
formal charge, so our pattern,

228
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,631
this time, our pattern is one bond.

229
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,045
Here's the one bond, and then three

230
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,985
lone pairs of electrons.

231
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,077
So let me write that down.

232
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,457
So the pattern is one bond,

233
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,396
when oxygen has one bond,

234
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:50,396
and three lone pairs of electrons

235
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,942
the formal charge is negative one,

236
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:55,763
just like we saw up here
with the calculation.

237
00:08:55,763 --> 00:08:57,864
So we could leave those electrons off

238
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,060
if you wanted to save some time,

239
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,685
we could just say, oh, this is oxygen

240
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,496
with a negative one formal charge,

241
00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:03,768
and we should know that there must be

242
00:09:03,768 --> 00:09:06,925
three lone pairs of
electrons on that oxygen.

243
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,387
Let's look at one more example,

244
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:11,883
where formal charge is negative one.

245
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,308
So right here, this
oxygen has a negative one

246
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:15,968
formal charge, and we can see

247
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,803
it already has one bond to it.

248
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:18,929
And so the pattern, of course,

249
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,785
is one bond plus three
lone pairs of electrons.

250
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:22,968
So we already have the one bond.

251
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:24,576
In order for that oxygen to have

252
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,246
a negative one formal charge,

253
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:28,347
we need three lone pairs of electrons.

254
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,749
So we could re-draw this,

255
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:34,430
so that is one way to represent that ion,

256
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,426
and we could also represent it like this,

257
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:37,889
with putting three lone pairs

258
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:39,770
of electrons on that oxygen with

259
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,103
a negative one formal charge.

260
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:45,121
So again, become familiar
with these patterns.
