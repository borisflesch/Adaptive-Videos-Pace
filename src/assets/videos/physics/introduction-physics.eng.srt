1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,625
- [Voiceover] I could imagine

2
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:02,514
that even the earliest human beings,

3
00:00:02,514 --> 00:00:04,119
or possibly pre-human beings

4
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:06,231
had asked themselves the questions,

5
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:10,052
"Why am I here? What is the nature of reality?

6
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:13,972
"Why is the universe organized the way that it is?"

7
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,488
And these questions are what we attempt to answer

8
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:20,070
in the field of physics...

9
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,316
In the field of physics,

10
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:23,311
which you could view

11
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:24,612
maybe right after mathematics

12
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:27,761
as the purest of the sciences.

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,646
So you have math, which is very pure,

14
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:33,592
and then on that foundation of math

15
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:34,933
you have physics.

16
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:39,159
And physics really does try to use that mathematics

17
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,048
along with some core ideas

18
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:43,060
to explain the phenomena,

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,238
all the phenomena,

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:45,437
of the universe.

21
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,204
And physicists will the the first to admit

22
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:49,643
that they are just beginning to understand

23
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:51,065
the nature of reality,

24
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:53,076
the nature of everything around us.

25
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:54,986
Now a lot of times, we think physics

26
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:59,638
is only limited to things like cosmological phenomena

27
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:01,730
or getting rockets into space,

28
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:04,779
or how waves move or building structures.

29
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,378
But physics is the foundation for

30
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,452
all of the other sciences.

31
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:10,630
When we think about chemistry,

32
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,518
when we think about chemistry,

33
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,678
which is at the end of the day

34
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:15,384
interactions between atoms,

35
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:18,858
those interactions are really physics-based interactions.

36
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:22,820
So chemistry, chemistry is actually laid down

37
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,990
on a foundation of physics.

38
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,062
And then even when we think about ourselves,

39
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,764
our bodies, even our consciousness, our brains,

40
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:35,437
it really all boils down to chemistry and physics.

41
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:37,997
It boils down to interactions between atoms

42
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,719
and even mechanical properties of our bodies.

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,829
And so even biology,

44
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,595
even what we are,

45
00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:49,943
is built on a foundation of chemistry.

46
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,072
So this is biology right over here,

47
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,901
which is built on a foundation of physics,

48
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,562
which is highly dependent on some of the math

49
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:59,268
that you've been learning your whole life

50
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,874
and that you will continue to learn.

51
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:03,006
And that fundamental question that you might have said,

52
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,958
"Well you know, hey, why am I learning this math?"

53
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,461
Well one, 'cause the math is beautiful,

54
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,859
but also you will see that it starts to,

55
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:10,687
in almost the most pure way,

56
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:13,044
describe the structure of the universe.

57
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:15,990
And we're going to see that more and more and more

58
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,473
as we go into physics.

59
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:19,139
All of this complex phenomena

60
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,033
that you see around us,

61
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,272
whether we're looking at a galaxy

62
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:22,694
or we're looking at ocean waves,

63
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,600
or we're looking at even biological systems,

64
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,138
we'll see that a shocking amount of them

65
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,695
can start to be described using some fairly elegant

66
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,503
mathematics that we can build on

67
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:34,702
and continue to build on.

68
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,815
Simple or elegant mathematics

69
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:40,919
like force is equal to mass times acceleration.

70
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,824
And we're gonna talk about force and acceleration

71
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:45,246
as vector quantities.

72
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:48,314
We're gonna think about things like displacement,

73
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,143
and I'll put it as a vector quantity,

74
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,317
and we'll soon learn more about vector

75
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:53,637
and scalar quantities are.

76
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:58,005
Displacement is equal to velocity times time.

77
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,321
We'll learn things like accelaration

78
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:04,385
is equal to change in velocity over change in time.

79
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,984
What we'll see with even a handful

80
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:09,281
of very simple ideas like this.

81
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,536
We'll go into much more depth in future videos.

82
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:14,320
You can explain all sorts of complex phenomena.

83
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,819
And the one thing that I always loved about physics,

84
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,626
and I don't think it's always fully appreciated,

85
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,110
sometimes as you start to learn physics,

86
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,979
you'll see all these complicated formula,

87
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,621
all of these kind of complicated problems,

88
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,221
but it's super valuable to realize

89
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,883
it's all coming from some of these basic ideas.

90
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:31,224
Some of the things that I just mentioned,

91
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:34,373
these ideas, we're gonna explore ideas of energy.

92
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:37,399
We're going to explore Newton's laws.

93
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,391
We're going to explain, we're gonna think about

94
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:41,992
what are the the different types of forces out there,

95
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,977
and why they might, why they might actually exist.

96
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:48,310
At its essence, it's all about trying to

97
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,033
explain the complexity of the universe,

98
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,738
predict what is going to happen

99
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,685
based on simple ideas.

100
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,022
And that's what physics is all about.

101
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,708
Now when we think of physics,

102
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,978
it's been studied by humanity for a very, very long time.

103
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,036
In fact, I'm sure we don't know

104
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,733
who the first physicists were.

105
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:08,883
But some of the,

106
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:11,321
I guess you could say foundational thinkers

107
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,490
in physics are these gentlemen that I have here.

108
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,343
And this is just a...

109
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,603
You could kind of say

110
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,569
this is some of the most prominent thinkers in physics,

111
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,886
but this is by no means a complete list.

112
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,238
First and foremost, we'd wanna include Isaac Newton.

113
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:27,838
Especially when you start to study physics,

114
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:30,219
you're starting to understand the world

115
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,621
as Newton understood it.

116
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,881
He understood, "Hey, you know,

117
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,344
"things don't fall to the ground

118
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:35,664
"just 'cause they always fall to,

119
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:37,207
"just 'cause that's the way the universe is.

120
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,748
"That's a force that's acting on it,

121
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,820
"and maybe that same force that's causing me

122
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,137
"to be stuck to my chair right now

123
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:46,839
"is what keeps Earth orbiting around the Sun

124
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,882
"or the moon orbiting around the Earth."

125
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:53,096
He developed Law of Gravitation,

126
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:54,844
Newton's Laws, and we're going to study that

127
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,627
as we delve into our basic physics.

128
00:04:57,627 --> 00:04:58,623
And what we'll see,

129
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,003
even classical mechanics,

130
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:03,052
the physics that Newton established,

131
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,977
can explain a large range of phenomena

132
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:07,277
with amazing precision.

133
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:10,325
But as we get into the early 20th century,

134
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,397
physics starts to get even more wild

135
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:14,393
as we start to look at the scales

136
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:15,592
of the super small,

137
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:18,842
and we have Max Planck giving us quantum mechanics,

138
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,712
and then we have Albert Einstein

139
00:05:20,712 --> 00:05:23,840
as we start thinking about super fast speeds,

140
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,380
the speed of light, and we realize that's an absolute.

141
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,102
That nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,

142
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:31,378
which is this mind-boggling thing

143
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,674
that we have these notions

144
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:35,787
of general and special relativity,

145
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,697
and we start realizing that the universe

146
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:40,521
is in some ways more bizarre, and more mysterious,

147
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:43,548
and more fascinating than we ever could have imagined.

148
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:46,413
But all of the work, even to understand the modern physics

149
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,135
of Max Planck and Albert Einstein,

150
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:52,203
it's based on a lot of the core ideas

151
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:54,133
that were given to us by Isaac Newton,

152
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,226
even people before Isaac Newton.

153
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:58,725
So as you go into your study of physics,

154
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,671
and I'm kind of a physicist wannabe.

155
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,479
I wanted to be a physicist.

156
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,676
I imagined kind of,

157
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:06,933
'cause it's all about, we all wonder,

158
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,969
why are we here?

159
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,777
What is the nature of reality?

160
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:12,378
Why do things happen the way they are?

161
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,979
And these are the questions that physics

162
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,623
is attempting to answer.

163
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:19,225
And so as you go into your study of physics,

164
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,074
I wanna leave you with some quotes

165
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:22,801
from these three gentlemen.

166
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:25,401
So the first two are from Isaac Newton.

167
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:29,018
"Truth is ever to be found in simplicity,

168
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:32,594
"and not in the multiplicity and the confusion of things."

169
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:34,300
And I really wanted to stress this,

170
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,661
because a lot of times in your studies,

171
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,795
you might be finding yourself memorizing formulas

172
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:41,208
and vocabulary, but that's,

173
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,768
if you're doing that, you're just at the very surface.

174
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,758
But if you really start to think about it,

175
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,055
really start to think about where these things come from,

176
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,285
it'll come to simpler and simpler and more intuitive ideas.

177
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,577
And then, you are getting closer to the truth.

178
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:57,380
Now, I love this second quote from Isaac Newton.

179
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,265
"I do not know what I may appear to...

180
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:03,171
"I do not know what I may appear to the world,

181
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:07,234
"but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy

182
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:08,534
"playing on the seashore,

183
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:11,033
"and diverting myself in now and then

184
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:12,699
"finding a smoother pebble

185
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,426
"or prettier shell than ordinary,

186
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:17,352
"whilst the great ocean of truth

187
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:20,520
"lay all undiscovered before me."

188
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,126
I like to imagine there's so much,

189
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,320
we, even though we think we know so much,

190
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,571
that we haven't even learned a small fraction

191
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,258
of how the universe really is.

192
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:31,594
And even a great thinker like Isaac Newton,

193
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:32,630
he recognized this.

194
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,113
He's like, "Hey, I'm just kind of dabbling

195
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:36,572
"into the seashore and picking up a pebble there,

196
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:37,750
"but there's this vast ocean

197
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,558
"that I can't even begin to understand."

198
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,488
You can even imagine alien civilizations

199
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,845
that are thousands of years ahead of us

200
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:45,918
technologically or scientifically

201
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:47,157
or even millions of years,

202
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:49,067
how they might perceive the reality,

203
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,408
and they might see us as ants

204
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:51,789
in that we are just beginning

205
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,308
to scrape the surface of how the world works.

206
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:56,836
This is from Max Planck.

207
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:59,173
"When you change the way you look at things,

208
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,286
"the things you look at change."

209
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:03,947
And I find this to be pretty profound,

210
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:04,739
because it is true.

211
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:05,674
As you study physics,

212
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:06,587
you will start to see, whoa,

213
00:08:06,588 --> 00:08:08,234
most of what we consider to be reality,

214
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:09,717
our current understanding is based

215
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:11,789
on these forces, but what are these forces?

216
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,003
And even these things that we think are solid,

217
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,650
when we go down to the atomic level,

218
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,111
we see it's mostly empty space

219
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:18,819
and it's really just the interaction of forces

220
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:20,790
that make us think that something

221
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,594
is solid or there or tangible is some way.

222
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:24,933
And you realize these very tangible things

223
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:27,149
aren't so tangible after all.

224
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:28,774
At the end of the day, the whole world

225
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,477
is just a mental model that we have.

226
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,308
In some ways,

227
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:34,971
it's an illusion

228
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:37,815
that our mind creates so that we can operate inside of it.

229
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,313
But we're just beginning to understand it.

230
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,040
And last but not least,

231
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,464
and there's actually a ton of great quotes

232
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:44,825
from these folks and others,

233
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,450
but especially Albert Einstein.

234
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,340
"The most beautiful experience

235
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,453
"we can have is the mysterious.

236
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,399
"It is the fundamental emotion that stands

237
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,446
"at the cradle of true art and true science."

238
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:58,762
And I really want you to take this to heart

239
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,122
as you study your physics.

240
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,155
There will be times where we're going

241
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,435
to be building our tool kits.

242
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:04,146
What's a vector?

243
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:04,776
What's a scalar?

244
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:06,280
Going into some mathematics,

245
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,702
proving some formulas.

246
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,165
Those are the tool kits,

247
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,647
but then we're gonna try to understand

248
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,050
fundamental phenomena.

249
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,243
How does the universe actually work?

250
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:16,397
And if when we start to think about these,

251
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,856
you don't get a few chills on your skin,

252
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:21,538
a few goosebumps, and feel that the universe

253
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:23,569
is more mysterious than you thought,

254
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:25,419
then we're not studying physics

255
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,734
the say that we should be studying physics.
