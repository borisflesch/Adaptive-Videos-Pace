1
00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:01,740
What I want to do
in this video is

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,379
talk about the difference
between vectors and scalars.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,259
And they might sound like
very complicated ideas,

4
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:13,050
but we'll see over the
course of the videos

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,874
that they're actually
very simple ideas.

6
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:18,040
So first I'll give you a
little bit of a definition.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,250
And then I'll give you
a bunch of examples,

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,780
and I think the examples
will make things super clear.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,030
Hopefully, they'll make
things super clear.

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,040
A vector is something
that has a magnitude,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,269
or you could kind of
view that as a size,

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,290
and it has a direction.

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,065
So "and" it has a direction.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,379
A scalar only has a
magnitude, or size.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,550
And if that doesn't
make sense to you,

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,070
it will hopefully
make sense to you

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,910
in a second when I
show you an example.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,830
For example.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,160
Let's say that I have,
let's say that that's

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,019
the ground-- let me do
the ground in a more

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,640
appropriate ground-like color.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,970
So this is green
right over here.

23
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,440
And let's say that
I have a brick here.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,940
I have a brick on the ground.

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,670
And I pick up that
brick, and I move it over

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,370
to this place right over here.

27
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,390
So I move the brick
right over there.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,610
And then I take a ruler
out, and I say, wow,

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,305
I've moved the brick 5 meters.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,190
So my question to you, is
my measurement of 5 meters,

31
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,520
is it a vector or a scalar?

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,149
Well, if I just
tell you 5 meters,

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,580
you just know the
size of the movement.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,480
You just know the
magnitude of the movement.

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,050
So if someone were
to just say 5 meters,

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,670
this is a scalar quantity.

37
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,400
And when we're referring
to moving something,

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,380
or how much something has, I
guess, changed its position,

39
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,979
and I don't give
you the direction,

40
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,790
we're talking about distance.

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,889
And I'm assuming you've
heard the word distance.

42
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,900
How far of a distance
has something traveled?

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,890
So this is distance.

44
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,489
So we could say that this
block, or this brick,

45
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,380
because of my picking
it up and moving it,

46
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,589
has moved a distance
of 5 meters.

47
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:22,380
But if I didn't show
you this picture here,

48
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,754
and someone just
told you that it

49
00:02:23,754 --> 00:02:25,829
moved a distance
of 5 meters, you

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,830
wouldn't know if it moved
to the right 5 meters,

51
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,955
you wouldn't know if it
moved to the left 5 meters,

52
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,600
if it moved up or
down or in or out,

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,808
or-- You don't know what
direction it moved 5 meters.

54
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:36,209
You just know it moved 5 meters.

55
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,070
If you want to
specify that, so, we

56
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,489
could say that this
brick right over here,

57
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:49,285
that it moved 5
meters to the left.

58
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,140
Now we have specified a
magnitude, right over there.

59
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,989
So that is a magnitude.

60
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,360
And we have specified a
direction, to the left.

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,590
So you now explicitly know that
they went 5 meters to the-- oh,

62
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,140
sorry.

63
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,829
It should be 5
meters to the right.

64
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,150
Let me change that.

65
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,990
So, 5 meters to the right
is what it got moved.

66
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,250
It started here and went
5 meters to the right.

67
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,740
So once again, the
magnitude is 5 meters,

68
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,520
and the direction
is to the right.

69
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,670
So what I've just
described to you right here

70
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,579
is a vector quantity.

71
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,770
So this, all of this
business right over here,

72
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,941
this is a vector.

73
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:40,940
And when you talk about
the movement, the change

74
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,030
in position, and you give its
direction, the vector version

75
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,960
of distance, I guess you could
call it, is displacement.

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,223
So this right here
is displacement.

77
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,640
So the correct thing
to say, you would

78
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,950
say that this brick
has been displaced

79
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,420
5 meters to the
right, or it has been

80
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,989
moved a distance of 5 meters.

81
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,820
Distance is a scalar
quantity-- I didn't tell you

82
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,430
what direction we moved it in.

83
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,870
Displacement is a
vector quantity.

84
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,430
We told you that
it is to the right.

85
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,390
Now let's explore this if
we talk about the actual,

86
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,740
well, we'll talk about the
speed or velocity of something.

87
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,290
So let's say that this
5 meters was traveled

88
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,684
and let's say that
the change in time--

89
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:35,350
let me just, because
you're probably not

90
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,599
familiar with what that means.

91
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:41,390
So let's say that the
change in time right here,

92
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,919
when I moved this
block 5 meters,

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,100
let's say that it
was, I don't know,

94
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,420
let's say that the change
in time was 2 seconds.

95
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,190
So maybe right when the
block started moving, maybe

96
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,400
on my stopwatch it said 0.

97
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,340
And then on my stopwatch
when it stopped moving,

98
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,210
it said, or when it
got to this position,

99
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,168
I should say-- when it
left from this position,

100
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,580
my stopwatch said 0.

101
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,000
When it got to this position
my stopwatch said 2 seconds.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
So the change in time, or the
duration we're dealing with,

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,446
is 2 seconds.

104
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,070
And this is, for all
we know, time only

105
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,550
goes in the positive direction.

106
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,159
So you could assume
that it's, you

107
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,200
could pick that as a vector
or a scalar quantity,

108
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,740
I guess, because there's
only one direction for time,

109
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,320
as far as we know, or
at least in what we're

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,070
going to deal with for
the simple physics.

111
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,000
So what is a measure of
how fast this thing moved?

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,320
So, how fast did
this thing move?

113
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,430
So we could say it moved
5 meters in 2 seconds.

114
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,460
Let me write this down.

115
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,310
So it moved 5 meters
per 2 seconds.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,820
Or we could write this as
5/2 of a meter per second.

117
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,180
Or 5 divided by 2 is what?

118
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,230
5 divided by 2 is 2.5
meters per second.

119
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,430
This right here is just
the 5 divided by 2,

120
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,910
let me make that clear.

121
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,230
That right there is just
the 5 divided by the 2.

122
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,300
So my question to you.

123
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,450
This 2.5 meters per
second tells you

124
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,550
how far it traveled in a
certain amount of time.

125
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,782
Is this a vector or
a scalar quantity?

126
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,240
It is telling you
how fast it went,

127
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,250
but is it giving you just
a size of how fast it went?

128
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,090
Or is it also giving
you direction?

129
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,729
Well, I don't see
any direction here.

130
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,700
So this is a scalar quantity.

131
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,469
And the scalar quantity for
how fast something is going

132
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,920
is speed.

133
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,100
So we could say that
the speed of the brick

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,162
is 2.5 meters per second.

135
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:57,620
Now, if we do the
same calculation,

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,290
and we say it went
5 meters-- I'll just

137
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:13,500
write m for meters-- to the
right in 2 seconds, then

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,660
what do we get?

139
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,860
We get 2.5, once again, 2.5
meters per second-- I'll

140
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,005
just abbreviate them as meters
per second-- to the right.

141
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,220
So is this a vector
or a scalar quantity?

142
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,840
I'm telling you the magnitude
of the speed, that's right here.

143
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,169
This is the magnitude,
2.5 meters per second.

144
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,760
And I'm also telling you
the direction, to the right.

145
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,909
So this is a vector quantity.

146
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,650
This is a vector quantity.

147
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,000
And when you specify both
the speed and the direction,

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,080
so the 2.5 meters per second
is a scalar, and the direction,

149
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,969
you are talking about velocity.

150
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,510
You are talking about velocity.

151
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,140
So an easy way to
think about it,

152
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,300
if you're thinking
about change in position

153
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,750
and you specify the direction
of the change in position,

154
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,660
you're talking
about displacement.

155
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,620
If you're not talking
about the direction,

156
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,370
you want the scalar version,
you're talking about distance.

157
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,920
If you're talking about how
fast something is going,

158
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,420
and you give the direction
that it's going in,

159
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,170
you're talking about velocity.

160
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,077
If you don't give the direction
you are talking about speed.

161
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:27,660
Hopefully that helps
you a little bit.

162
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,670
In the next video,
we're going start

163
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,336
working with these a
little bit to start

164
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,808
solving some basic questions
about how fast something

165
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:35,459
is going, or how
far it might travel,

166
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,760
or how long it might
take it to get someplace.
