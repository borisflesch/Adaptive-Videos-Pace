00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,489
- [Instructor] We are told a pig runs

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,210
rightward 20 meters to eat a juicy apple.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,040
It then walks leftward five meters

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,270
to eat a nut.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,070
Finally it walks leftward

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,950
another 25 meters

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,990
to eat another nut.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,029
The total time taken by the pig

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,300
was 300 seconds.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,480
What was the pig's average velocity

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,070
and average speed over this time?

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,190
And assume rightwards is positive

13
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,280
and leftwards is negative

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,580
and round your answer to
two significant digits.

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,500
So, pause this video
and try to work it out

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,620
on your own.

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,160
All right, now let's do this together

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,519
and first let's just draw a diagram

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,180
of what is going on.

20
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,400
So, this is our pig.

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,500
It first runs rightward 20 meters,

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,800
so we could say that's a
positive 20-meter displacement,

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,750
so it goes plus 20 meters,

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,290
ends up right over there.

25
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,019
Then it walks leftwards five meters,

26
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,270
so then from there

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,750
it's gonna walk leftwards five meters,

28
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,130
so we could call that a
negative five-meter displacement

29
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,460
and then finally, it walks
leftward another 25 meters.

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,380
So, then it walks leftward
another 25 meters,

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,213
so it gets right over there,

32
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:16,490
so that would be a displacement

33
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,869
of negative 25 meters to eat another nut,

34
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:23,850
so it ends up right over there.

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,919
Now, to figure out our average velocity,

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,180
let me write it down,

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,060
so our velocity average

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,970
and even this is one dimensional,

39
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,070
it is a vector, it has direction to it.

40
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,279
We specify the direction with the sign

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
positive being rightwards being positive

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,240
and leftwards being negative.

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,179
You oftentimes for one-dimensional vectors

44
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,500
might not see an arrow there

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,490
or might not see it bolded

46
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,059
and just written like this.

47
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,050
But our average velocity
is going to be equal

48
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,470
to, you could view it as our displacement

49
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,340
or our change in X

50
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,370
divided by how much time

51
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,870
has actually lapsed

52
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,450
and so, what is our
displacement going to be?

53
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,544
What's it?

54
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:05,280
We have plus 20 meters

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,181
and then we have minus five meters

56
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:11,619
and then we go to the
left another 25 meters,

57
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,710
minus 25 meters

58
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,900
and then all of that is going
to over the elapsed change

59
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,800
or change in time,

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,340
all of that is over 300 seconds.

61
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,790
So, what is this numerator going to be?

62
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,390
This is 20 minus 30,

63
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,239
so that's gonna be equal to negative 10,

64
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,442
so this is equal to negative 10 meters

65
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:36,050
over 300 seconds.

66
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,050
So, the average velocity

67
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,050
is going to be equal to
negative 1/30 meters per second,

68
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,769
the negative specifies that on average

69
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,630
the velocity is towards the left.

70
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,500
If you wanna specify this as a decimal

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,010
with two significant digits,

72
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,130
this is going to be,

73
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,130
so this will approximately equal to 0.033.

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,429
That would be 1/30.

75
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,807
Now let's try to tackle average speed.

76
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,880
So, our speed,

77
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,579
R sometimes is used for speed, R for rate,

78
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,610
our average speed

79
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,100
is not going to be our displacement

80
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,799
divided by our lapsed time,

81
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,620
it is going to be our distance

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,630
divided by our elapsed time

83
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,710
and we'll see that these are
not going to be the same thing.

84
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,210
That's one of the points of this problem,

85
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,570
so our distance divided
by our lapsed time.

86
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,070
So, what's our distance traveled?

87
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,380
Well, it's gonna be the absolute value

88
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,420
of each of these numbers,

89
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,149
so it's gonna be 20 meters

90
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,090
plus five meters plus 25 meters.

91
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,590
Notice, there's a difference here.

92
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,280
We're not subtracting the five and the 25,

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,820
we're just adding all of that.

94
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,224
We just care about the magnitudes.

95
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,260
Divided by 300 seconds

96
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,940
and so, this is going to
be equal to 50 meters,

97
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,160
over 300 seconds

98
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,200
which is equal to five over 30

99
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,049
which is equal to 1/6
of a meter per second

100
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,510
and if we want to write it as a decimal,

101
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,450
let's see, six goes into one,

102
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,339
let's put some zeros here,

103
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,680
six goes into 10 one time,

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,260
one times six is six,

105
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,429
I can scroll down a little bit

106
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,260
and then we subtract, we get a four,

107
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,459
six goes into 40 six times,

108
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,140
six times six is 36

109
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,120
and then we get,

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,850
let me just scroll down
a little bit more again

111
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:31,540
and then we get another four

112
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,810
and then we're just gonna
keep getting sixes over here,

113
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,600
so this is gonna be
approximately equal to 0.1,

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,380
if we want two significant digits,

115
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,520
17 meters per second

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,450
and we are done.

117
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,409
We figured out the average velocity

118
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,980
and the average speed.
