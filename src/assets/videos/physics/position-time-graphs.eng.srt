00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,182
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

2
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:06,631
is think about different ways
to represent how position

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,381
can change over time.

4
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:11,209
So one of the more basic ways

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,793
is through a table.

6
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:16,463
For example right over
here in the left column

7
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:18,920
I have time, maybe it's in seconds,

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,170
and in the right column I have position

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,810
and this could be in some
units, let's say it's in meters.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,831
So at time zero we're at three,

11
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:30,150
after one second, we are still at three,

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,546
after two seconds we're at negative one

13
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:34,458
then after three seconds, we're at zero,

14
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,147
after four seconds we're at zero,

15
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:40,214
still at zero, after five
seconds we are at two,

16
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:41,992
maybe two meters.

17
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:44,650
Now this is somewhat useful,
but it's a little bit

18
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,567
difficult to visualize.

19
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,501
And it also doesn't
tell us what's happening

20
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:52,397
in between these moments, what's happening

21
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:54,481
at time half of a second.

22
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:57,976
Did we just not move, did
our position just not change,

23
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,745
or did it change and
then it got back to where

24
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,971
it originally was after one second?

25
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:05,990
We don't know when we
look at a table like this.

26
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,833
But another way to think about it would be

27
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,219
some type of animation.

28
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,872
For example, let's say
we have our number line,

29
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:17,355
and let's say the object
that's moving is a lemon.

30
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:20,541
And so at time zero, it
starts at position three,

31
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,997
so that's where it is
right now, and let's see

32
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,199
if we can animate it.

33
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,002
I'm just gonna try to
count off five seconds

34
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,529
and move the lemon
accordingly to what we see

35
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:33,696
on this position timetable
or time position table.

36
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:35,490
Zero

37
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:37,929
one

38
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:38,762
two

39
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,100
three

40
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:43,931
four

41
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:45,734
five.

42
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:50,857
So that was somewhat useful,
but maybe even more useful

43
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,243
thing would be to graph this somehow

44
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:54,860
so that we don't have to keep looking

45
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,699
at animation so that we can just look at

46
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,574
with our eyes what happens over time.

47
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:02,795
So for that, we can construct what's known

48
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:04,879
as a position time graph.

49
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:09,798
Typically, time is on your horizontal axis

50
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:12,912
and position is on your vertical axis.

51
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:15,345
So let's think about this a little bit.

52
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,982
So at time equals zero,
our position is at three.

53
00:02:18,982 --> 00:02:22,558
So at time zero, our position is at three,

54
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:26,641
and then at time equal
one, we're at three again,

55
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,821
at time two, we are at negative one,

56
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:35,546
at time two, our position is negative one,

57
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:38,546
at time three, our position is zero,

58
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:41,388
so our position is zero.

59
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:42,968
Remember, even though we're thinking about

60
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:46,815
left right here, here position is up down.

61
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:51,115
So here our position
is zero at time three,

62
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:55,785
and then at time four, our
position is still zero,

63
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:59,618
and then at time five,
our position is at two.

64
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,956
Our position is at two.

65
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:08,554
So for the first second,
I don't have a change

66
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,515
in position or at least
that's what I assumed

67
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:14,327
when I animated the
lemon, and then as I go

68
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,575
from the first second
to the second second,

69
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:20,043
my position went from
three to negative one,

70
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:22,293
from three to negative
one, and if we do that

71
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:24,764
at a constant rate we would have a line

72
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:27,113
that looks something
like this, I'm trying,

73
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:29,343
that's supposed to be a straight line,

74
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,636
and then from time two to
three, we go from position

75
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:37,239
negative one to zero,
from negative one to zero.

76
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,895
Here, it would've been
going from negative one

77
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:43,737
to zero moving one to
the right, but over here,

78
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:46,343
since we're plotting our
position on the vertical axis,

79
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:48,702
it looks like we went up
but this is just really

80
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:52,341
going from position negative
one to position zero

81
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:55,470
from time two seconds to three seconds.

82
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,503
Now from three to four, at
least the way I depicted it,

83
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,603
our position does not change,
and then from time four

84
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:04,271
to five, our position
goes from zero to two,

85
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:06,689
from zero to two.

86
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:10,166
And so what I have
constructed here is known

87
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,858
as a position time graph, and from this,

88
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:15,549
without an animation, you can immediately

89
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,163
get an understanding of
how the thing's position

90
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:20,142
has changed over time.

91
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:22,359
So let's do the animation one more time,

92
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,275
and just try to follow along
on the position time graph,

93
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:27,669
and maybe I'll slow it down a little bit.

94
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,769
So for the first second
we're gonna be stationary,

95
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,186
so we can just count off one Mississippi.

96
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:39,090
And then we go to, our
position goes to negative one

97
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,256
over the next second, so then
we would go two Mississippi.

98
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:49,378
And then we would go three Mississippi,

99
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:53,044
four Mississippi, and
then five Mississippi.

100
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:57,117
But hopefully you get an appreciation

101
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,335
that this is just the way
of immediately glancing

102
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:00,393
and seeing what's happening.
