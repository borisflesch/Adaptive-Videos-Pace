        `22`,
        `00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,857`,

        `27`,
        `00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:22,349`,

        `28`,
        `00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:27,345`,

        `29`,
        `00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:34,087`,

        `31`,
        `00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,706`,
        `that were exchanged across the Atlantic`,
        
        `32`,
        `00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:43,590`,
        `after Columbus began the process`,
        
        `33`,
        `00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,576`,
        `of bringing things from the`,
        `Old World to the New World,`,
        
        `34`,
        `00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:50,678`,
        `and from the New World to the Old World.`,
        
        `35`,
        `00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:54,378`,
        `So first let's take a`,
        `closer look at the plants.`,
        
        `36`,
        `00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:56,766`,
        `Now, Spain, much like Portugal, was hoping`,
        
        `37`,
        `00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,805`,
        `to use this tropical`,
        `landscape to grow cash crops.`,
        
        `38`,
        `00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:04,555`,
        `So Columbus brought with`,
        `him sugar and grapes`,
        
        `39`,
        `00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:09,673`,
        `for wine, and coffee, these were all crops`,
        
        `40`,
        `00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:12,770`,
        `that would fetch high prices in Europe.`,
        
        `41`,
        `00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,937`,
        `It was so lucrative to`,
        `grow sugar in the Caribbean`,
        
        `42`,
        `00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,505`,
        `that they didn't even`,
        `want to give up any space`,
        
        `43`,
        `00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,495`,
        `to grow food, they imported their food`,
        
        `44`,
        `00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:27,336`,
        `so that they could spend all`,
        `of their land growing sugar.`,
        
        `45`,
        `00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:30,338`,
        `The Europeans also brought New World crops`,
        
        `46`,
        `00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:32,561`,
        `back to the Old World,`,
        `and some of these it's`,
        
        `47`,
        `00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:36,257`,
        `almost impossible to`,
        `imagine a world before,`,
        
        `48`,
        `00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,605`,
        `for example, the tomato`,
        `had ever come to Europe.`,
        
        `49`,
        `00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,697`,
        `Can you imagine Italian`,
        `food with no tomato sauce?`,
        
        `50`,
        `00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:46,358`,
        `They also brought corn and potatoes`,
        
        `51`,
        `00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,858`,
        `and sweet potatoes and cassava, or manioc.`,
        
        `52`,
        `00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,370`,
        `And what's important about`,
        `most of these crops is`,
        
        `53`,
        `00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,370`,
        `that they're very calorically dense.`,
        
        `54`,
        `00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:03,129`,
        `So if you grew a field of potatoes,`,
        
        `55`,
        `00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:08,325`,
        `instead of a field of`,
        `wheat, which might be`,
        
        `56`,
        `00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:12,209`,
        `a typical crop grown in the`,
        `Old Word before contact,`,
        
        `57`,
        `00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,460`,
        `you can feed three times as many people`,
        
        `58`,
        `00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:21,208`,
        `with a field of potatoes`,
        `than you can with wheat.`,
        
        `59`,
        `00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,031`,
        `So what does this cause?`,
        
        `60`,
        `00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:27,390`,
        `It causes a real increase`,
        `in population in Europe.`,
        
        `61`,
        `00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,837`,
        `It also causes an increase`,
        `in population in Africa,`,
        
        `62`,
        `00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:34,667`,
        `where manioc is a crop`,
        `that was frequently grown`,
        
        `63`,
        `00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,163`,
        `and also very calorically dense.`,
        
        `64`,
        `00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:39,893`,
        `So New World foods`,
        `helped Europe and Africa`,
        
        `65`,
        `00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:42,344`,
        `increase their populations.`,
        
        `66`,
        `00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:44,137`,
        `So what about these animals?`,
        
        `67`,
        `00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:47,969`,
        `The Europeans brought cattle, sheep,`,
        
        `68`,
        `00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,136`,
        `pigs, and horses to the New`,
        `World, with mixed results.`,
        
        `69`,
        `00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:58,042`,
        `Horses, for example, were`,
        `a tremendous technology`,
        
        `70`,
        `00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:01,169`,
        `that was widely adopted throughout Mexico`,
        
        `71`,
        `00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,840`,
        `and the Native Americans`,
        `living in the Great Plains`,
        
        `72`,
        `00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,262`,
        `of what is today the United States found`,
        
        `73`,
        `00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:10,230`,
        `that horses revolutionized`,
        `their ability to hunt.`,
        
        `74`,
        `00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,929`,
        `So that was a great step up for them.`,
        
        `75`,
        `00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,777`,
        `The pigs they brought over, however,`,
        
        `76`,
        `00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:18,219`,
        `weren't so great because`,
        `Europeans allowed the pigs`,
        
        `77`,
        `00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:22,069`,
        `to roam freely, which meant`,
        `that they ate everything,`,
        
        `78`,
        `00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,242`,
        `including the Native Americans' crops,`,
        
        `79`,
        `00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:28,160`,
        `and they multiplied very quickly.`,
        
        `80`,
        `00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,098`,
        `So they became kind of`,
        `a pest in the New World.`,
        
        `81`,
        `00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:35,577`,
        `Probably the thing that`,
        `had the biggest affect`,
        
        `82`,
        `00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:39,310`,
        `in the Columbian Exchange was the transfer`,
        
        `83`,
        `00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,560`,
        `of Old World diseases to the New World.`,

        `85`,
        `00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,345`,
        `whooping cough, and the Native Americans`,
        
        `86`,
        `00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:55,228`,
        `had very little immunity`,

        `87`,

        `88`,
        `00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:03,242`,

        `55`,

        `56`,
        `00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:46,478`,
        `people could buy shares`,

        `60`,
        `00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:55,156`,

        `45`,

        `53`,
        `00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:01,464`,

        `56`,

        `89`,

        `98`,
        `00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:39,411`,

        `so I draw those in.`,
        
        `103`,
        `00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,576`,
        `What is the formal charge`,

        `104`,
        `00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,525`,
        `So the formal charge is equal to`,
        
        `105`,
        `00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,256`,
        `the number of valence electrons oxygen`,
        
        `106`,
        `00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,926`,
        `is supposed to have, which is six,`,
        
        `107`,
        `00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,480`,

        `109`,
        `00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,785`,

        `110`,
        `00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,561`,
        `so oxygen gets one from this bond,`,
        
        `111`,
        `00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:09,362`,
        `and one from this bond,`,
        
        `112`,
        `00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,882`,

        `113`,
        `00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:14,400`,
        `so how many electrons`,

        `114`,
        `00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,918`,
        `This would be one, two, three,`,
        
        `115`,

        `116`,
        `00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:24,918`,
        `So six minus five is equal to plus one,`,
        
        `117`,
        `00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,482`,

        `118`,
        `00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:31,802`,

        `120`,

        `121`,
        `00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,435`,

        `122`,
        `00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,870`,
        `so we have oxygen with`,

        `123`,
        `00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,065`,

        `125`,
        `00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,288`,
        `And so we can come up`,

        `126`,
        `00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,889`,
        `Here oxygen has three bonds,`,
        
        `127`,
        `00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,596`,
        `let me highlight those bonds.`,
        
        `128`,

        `I'll use red this time,`,
        
        `129`,
        `00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,554`,
        `so here's one bond, two bonds,`,
        
        `130`,
        `00:04:56,554 --> 00:04:58,840`,
        `and then three bonds`,
        `and then one lone pair`,
        
        `131`,
        `00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,659`,
        `of electrons, so the`,
        `pattern of three bonds`,
        
        `132`,
        `00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:07,361`,
        `plus one lone pair of electrons`,
        
        `133`,
        `00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:10,520`,
        `for oxygen will give you a formal charge`,
        
        `134`,
        `00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,412`,
        `of plus one, and again,`,
        
        `135`,
        `00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,038`,
        `it's good to recognize these patterns.`,

        `You should be able to do the calculation,`,
        
        `137`,
        `00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,776`,
        `and then after you do`,
        `enough of these problems,`,
        
        `138`,
        `00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,599`,
        `you can just look at it and figure out`,
        
        `139`,

        `143`,
        `00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,956`,
        `and the lone pairs were left off`,
        
        `144`,
        `00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,557`,
        `of this one, again, for`,
        `convenience reasons,`,
        
        `145`,
        `00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:33,380`,
        `so we'll start with this example`,
        
        `146`,
        `00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,957`,
        `on the left, we can see that the oxygen`,
        
        `147`,
        `00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,536`,
        `with a plus one formal charge`,
        
        `148`,
        `00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,940`,
        `has three bonds to it.`,
        
        `149`,
        `00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,784`,
        `Here's one, here's two,`,
        `and then here's three,`,
        
        `150`,
        `00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,619`,
        `so three bonds, in order for that oxygen`,
        
        `151`,
        `00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,163`,
        `to have a plus one formal charge,`,
        
        `152`,
        `00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:47,021`,
        `it must also have one lone pair`,
        
        `153`,
        `00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,818`,
        `of electrons on it, so you`,
        `could just leave them off`,
        
        `154`,
        `00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:50,887`,
        `and know that they're there,`,
        
        `155`,
        `00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,570`,
        `or you could go ahead and draw them in,`,
        
        `156`,
        `00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,869`,
        `and I'll draw them in on that oxygen.`,
        
        `157`,
        `00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:57,875`,
        `Now to our other example over here`,
        
        `158`,
        `00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,175`,
        `on the right.`,
        
        `159`,
        `00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,869`,
        `This is the oxygen with`,
        `a plus one formal charge,`,
        
        `160`,
        `00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:04,168`,
        `so that oxygen must have three bonds`,
        
        `161`,
        `00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,189`,
        `and one lone pair.`,
        
        `162`,
        `00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,432`,
        `So here are the three bonds,`,
        
        `163`,
        `00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,229`,
        `here's one, two, and three,`,
        
        `164`,
        `00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,366`,
        `and again, I didn't draw in the lone pair`,
        
        `165`,
        `00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,712`,
        `of electrons on the oxygen,`,
        
        `166`,
        `00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,136`,
        `but the lone pair is there,`,
        
        `167`,
        `00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:17,039`,
        `so I'll go ahead and put it in like that.`,
        
        `168`,
        `00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,199`,
        `So recognize this pattern,`,
        
        `169`,
        `00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,020`,
        `three bonds, plus one`,
        `lone pair for oxygen,`,
        
        `170`,
        `00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,037`,
        `gives us a formal charge of plus one.`,
        
        `171`,
        `00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,873`,
        `You could have also figured out`,
        
        `172`,
        `00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:28,137`,
        `how many electrons are necessary.`,
        
        `173`,
        `00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,471`,
        `Let's use this example, by,`,
        
        `174`,
        `00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,759`,
        `let me go ahead and re-draw it here.`,
        
        `175`,
        `00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,315`,
        `So how else could we figure out`,
        
        `176`,
        `00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,496`,
        `how many electrons are on that oxygen,`,
        
        `177`,
        `00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,397`,
        `if that oxygen has a`,
        `plus one formal charge.`,
        
        `178`,
        `00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,466`,
        `Well you could say that, all right,`,
        
        `179`,
        `00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,103`,
        `the calculation for formal charge`,
        
        `180`,
        `00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:46,352`,
        `would be six minus x`,
        `is what we don't know,`,
        
        `181`,
        `00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,489`,
        `but we do know the formal`,
        `charge is plus one,`,
        
        `182`,
        `00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,647`,
        `so let me just put this`,
        `in a little box over here.`,
        
        `183`,
        `00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:53,666`,
        `So six minus x is equal to plus one.`,
        
        `184`,
        `00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,743`,
        `Obviously, x would have`,
        `to be equal to five,`,
        
        `185`,
        `00:06:56,743 --> 00:07:00,040`,
        `meaning that oxygen`,
        `would have five electrons`,
        
        `186`,
        `00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,524`,
        `around it, let's think about how many`,
        
        `187`,
        `00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,205`,
        `electrons we see right now around oxygens.`,
        
        `188`,
        `00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:08,039`,
        `So let me draw in some electrons here`,
        
        `189`,
        `00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,604`,
        `and I'll use red, so this bond`,
        
        `190`,
        `00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,881`,
        `is two electrons, and then we have`,
        
        `191`,
        `00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,866`,
        `a bunch of electrons in here,`,
        
        `192`,
        `00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,399`,
        `so how many electrons around oxygen`,
        
        `193`,
        `00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,141`,
        `do we have so far?`,
        
        `194`,
        `00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,706`,
        `Well, we would have three,`,
        
        `195`,
        `00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,342`,
        `just these three, and we need five,`,
        
        `196`,
        `00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,804`,
        `which means we need two more,`,
        
        `197`,
        `00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:26,335`,
        `which means we need a`,
        `lone pair of electrons`,
        
        `198`,
        `00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,681`,
        `on the oxygen.`,
        
        `199`,
        `00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:31,276`,
        `So that's a little bit too complicated,`,
        
        `200`,
        `00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,430`,
        `I think, for figuring it out,`,
        
        `201`,
        `00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,928`,
        `but you could use that method,`,
        
        `202`,
        `00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:36,053`,
        `or you could just learn`,
        `this pattern, right,`,
        
        `203`,
        `00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,794`,
        `and eventually, you'll`,
        `have to have this pattern`,
        
        `204`,
        `00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:39,454`,
        `down pretty well.`,
        
        `205`,
        `00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:41,230`,
        `Let's look at another example`,
        
        `206`,
        `00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,168`,
        `for assigning formal charge to oxygen.`,
        
        `207`,
        `00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:45,572`,
        `So our goal is to find the formal charge`,
        
        `208`,
        `00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:47,894`,
        `on oxygen in this example,`,
        
        `209`,
        `00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:50,436`,
        `and we put in our electrons in this bond.`,
        
        `210`,
        `00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,037`,
        `Each bond represents two electrons,`,
        
        `211`,
        `00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,126`,
        `so the formal charge on oxygen,`,
        
        `212`,
        `00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,878`,
        `is equal to the number`,
        `of valence electrons`,
        
        `213`,
        `00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,514`,
        `that oxygen is supposed`,
        `to have which is six,`,
        
        `214`,
        `00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,359`,
        `minus the number of valence electrons`,
        
        `215`,
        `00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,541`,
        `that oxygen actually has,`,
        
        `216`,
        `00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,517`,
        `and in this example, right,`,
        
        `217`,
        `00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,933`,
        `we would take one of these electrons`,
        
        `218`,
        `00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,860`,
        `from this bond, and how many electrons`,
        
        `219`,
        `00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,136`,
        `is that total around oxygen?`,
        
        `220`,
        `00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:13,795`,
        `This would be one, two, three,`,
        
        `221`,
        `00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:16,453`,
        `four, five, six, seven,`,
        
        `222`,
        `00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:19,239`,
        `so six minus seven`,
        `gives us a formal charge`,
        
        `223`,
        `00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,631`,

        `224`,
        `00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,592`,
        `So I could re-draw that over here,`,
        
        `225`,
        `00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,635`,

        `227`,
        `00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:32,799`,
        `formal charge, so our pattern,`,
        
        `228`,
        `00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,631`,

        `229`,
        `00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,045`,
        `Here's the one bond, and then three`,
        
        `230`,
        `00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,985`,
        `lone pairs of electrons.`,
        
        `231`,
        `00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,077`,
        `So let me write that down.`,
        
        `232`,
        `00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,457`,
        `So the pattern is one bond,`,
        
        `233`,
        `00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,396`,

        `234`,
        `00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:50,396`,
        `and three lone pairs of electrons`,
        
        `235`,
        `00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,942`,
        `the formal charge is negative one,`,
        
        `236`,
        `00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:55,763`,
        `just like we saw up here`,

        `237`,
        `00:08:55,763 --> 00:08:57,864`,
        `So we could leave those electrons off`,

        `239`,
        `00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,685`,

        `240`,

        `241`,
        `00:09:02,496 --> 00:09:03,768`,

        `this carbon and this oxygen,`,
        
        `79`,
        `00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,629`,
        `it turns out to be the`,
        `exact same bond length`,
        
        `80`,
        `00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,504`,
        `as the bond between the`,

        `81`,
        `00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,712`,
        `so, it's the exact same bond length.`,
        
        `82`,
        `00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:47,095`,
        `And so, the hybrid,`,
        `again, is a better picture`,
        
        `83`,
        `00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:50,792`,
        `of what the anion actually looks like.`,
        
        `84`,
        `00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:53,543`,
        `Let's think about what`,
        `would happen if we just`,
        
        `85`,
        `00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:56,596`,
        `moved the electrons in magenta in.`,
        
        `86`,
        `00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:57,912`,
        `So if I go back to the very first thing`,
        
        `87`,
        `00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,461`,
        `I talked about, and you're`,
        `like, "Well, why didn't`,
        
        `88`,
        `00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:02,077`,
        `"we just stop, after moving`,
        `these electrons in magenta?"`,
        
        `89`,
        `00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,929`,
        `Let's go ahead and draw`,
        `what we would have,`,
        
        `90`,
        `00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,189`,
        `if we stopped after moving`,
        `in the electrons in magenta.`,
        
        `91`,
        `00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,227`,
        `So we would have this, so`,
        `the electrons in magenta`,
        
        `92`,
        `00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,273`,
        `moved in here, to form our double-bond,`,
        
        `93`,
        `00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:18,389`,
        `and if we don't push off`,
        `those electrons in blue,`,
        
        `94`,
        `00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,822`,
        `this might be our resonance`,

        `95`,
        `00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:23,699`,
        `with this one, is, of course the fact`,
        
        `96`,
        `00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,631`,
        `that this carbon here`,
        `has five bonds to it:`,
        
        `97`,
        `00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:30,662`,
        `So, one, two, three,`,
        `four, five; so five bonds,`,
        
        `98`,
        `00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:32,482`,
        `so 10 electrons around it.`,
        
        `99`,
        `00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,810`,
        `We know that carbon can't exceed the octet`,
        
        `100`,

        `101`,
        `00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:41,116`,
        `on the periodic table, so`,
        `this is not a valid structure,`,
        
        `102`,
        `00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:43,248`,
        `and so, this is one of`,
        `the patterns that we're`,
        
        `103`,
        `00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:45,796`,

        `104`,
        `00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,881`,
        `So the pattern is, a`,

        `105`,
        `00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:52,582`,
        `so next to a pi bond, which is the example`,
        
        `106`,
        `00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:55,497`,
        `we see here for the acetate anion, and so`,
        
        `107`,

        `these are the two resonance structures.`,

        `the anion will resonate back and forth`,

        `113`,
        `00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:11,233`,

        `132`,

        `it's de-localized, so we`,

        `134`,
        `00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,515`,
        `we can draw a resonance structure, and so`,
        
        `135`,
        `00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:05,865`,
        `this negative-one formal`,

        `137`,
        `00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,374`,

        `138`,
        `00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:15,748`,
        `negative charge, that`,

        `140`,
        `00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,997`,
        `so increased stability,`,

        `141`,
        `00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:26,747`,
        `So, the fact that we can draw`,

        `145`,
        `00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:36,983`,
        `so we're moving electrons`,

        `146`,
        `00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:40,380`,

        `148`,
        `00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:46,787`,
        `So, the only way to get`,

        `149`,
        `00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:49,232`,
        `a lot of practice problems,`,

        `150`,
        `00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,315`,
        `do lots of practice`,
        `problems in your textbook.`,
        
        `151`,

        `If we compare that to the ethoxide anion,`,
        
        `152`,
        `00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,733`,
        `so over here, if we try`,

        `153`,
        `00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,565`,
        `if we try to take a lone pair of electrons`,

        `156`,
        `00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:08,830`,
        `already has four bonds;`,
        `so it's already bonded`,
        
        `157`,
        `00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:12,233`,
        `to two hydrogens, and then we`,

        `158`,
        `00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,316`,
        `And so, moving those`,
        `electrons in, trying to`,
        
        `159`,
        `00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,614`,
        `de-localize those electrons, would give us`,
        
        `160`,
        `00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,832`,
        `five bonds to carbon,`,
        `and so we can't do that;`,
        
        `161`,
        `00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:20,913`,
        `we can't draw a resonance structure`,
        
        `162`,
        `00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:22,631`,
        `for the ethoxide anion.`,
        
        `163`,
        `00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:25,398`,
        `So those electrons are`,

        `164`,
        `00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,965`,
        `and so this oxygen has a full,`,

        `165`,
        `00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,765`,

        `166`,

        `consists of two electrons.`,
        
        `64`,
        `00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,057`,
        `Let me put those in here.`,
        
        `65`,
        `00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:55,911`,
        `And again, we think`,
        `about electronegativity.`,
        
        `66`,
        `00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,406`,
        `This time on the right, this carbon`,
        
        `67`,
        `00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:01,656`,
        `is bonded to an oxygen now so carbon loses`,
        
        `68`,
        `00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,967`,
        `those two electrons to oxygen.`,
        
        `69`,
        `00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,151`,
        `Right, oxygen's more electronegative.`,
        
        `70`,
        `00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,609`,
        `Oxygen takes, this top oxygen`,
        `takes those four electrons`,
        
        `71`,
        `00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,212`,
        `and again, we split these two electrons.`,
        
        `72`,
        `00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,228`,
        `So, this time carbon is`,
        `only surrounded by one.`,
        
        `73`,
        `00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,527`,
        `So, define carbon's oxidation state`,
        
        `74`,
        `00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,850`,
        `we know that carbon's supposed`,
        
        `75`,
        `00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,370`,
        `to have four valence electrons`,
        
        `76`,
        `00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:22,311`,
        `and from that we subtract the number`,
        
        `77`,
        `00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:24,153`,
        `of valence electrons around carbon`,
        
        `78`,
        `00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,823`,
        `once we've accounted`,
        `for electronegativity.`,
        
        `79`,
        `00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,846`,
        `And that's only one electron now.`,
        
        `80`,
        `00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:31,030`,
        `So, four minus one gives us`,
        
        `81`,
        `00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,093`,
        `an oxidation state of plus three.`,
        
        `82`,
        `00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,554`,
        `So, on the right this same carbon`,
        
        `83`,
        `00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:40,180`,
        `now has an oxidation state of plus three.`,
        
        `84`,
        `00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,129`,
        `So, what happened in this reaction?`,
        
        `85`,
        `00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,852`,
        `Carbon went from an`,
        `oxidation state of plus one`,
        
        `86`,
        `00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,608`,
        `to an oxidation state of plus three.`,
        
        `87`,
        `00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:52,193`,
        `An increase in the oxidation`,
        `state is oxidation.`,
        
        `88`,
        `00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:55,434`,
        `So, our starting compound`,
        `was oxidized here.`,
        
        `89`,
        `00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,953`,
        `So, our starting compound was oxidized.`,
        
        `90`,
        `00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:00,890`,
        `In order for this to be oxidized`,
        
        `91`,
        `00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,928`,
        `we would need some sort`,
        `of oxidizing agent.`,
        
        `92`,
        `00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,194`,
        `So, I'll write that down`,
        `here really quickly.`,
        
        `93`,
        `00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:07,714`,
        `We would need an oxidizing agent`,
        
        `94`,
        `00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,712`,
        `to accomplish this reaction.`,
        
        `95`,
        `00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:12,209`,
        `And it's the oxidizing agent that itself`,
        
        `96`,
        `00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,196`,
        `is being reduced because remember,`,
        
        `97`,
        `00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:15,752`,
        `whenever something is being oxidized`,
        
        `98`,
        `00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:18,267`,
        `something else has to be reduced.`,
        
        `99`,
        `00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,924`,
        `Let's think about the`,
        `other definitions for,`,
        
        `100`,
        `00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,992`,
        `the other definition I`,
        `should say for oxidation.`,
        
        `101`,
        `00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:28,705`,
        `We know that oxidation`,
        `involves the loss of electrons.`,
        
        `102`,
        `00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,993`,
        `So, let's look at that here.`,
        
        `103`,
        `00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:33,793`,
        `On the left, right, carbon`,
        `had three electrons around it,`,
        
        `104`,
        `00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:36,996`,
        `and when we added a bond to oxygen,`,
        
        `105`,
        `00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:40,406`,
        `right, carbon lost these`,
        `two electrons over here.`,
        
        `106`,
        `00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,615`,
        `It had those two electrons.`,
        
        `107`,
        `00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,172`,
        `On the left it had those two electrons.`,
        
        `108`,
        `00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:45,250`,
        `On the right it lost those two electrons`,
        
        `109`,
        `00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,025`,
        `and now it's only surrounded by one.`,
        
        `110`,
        `00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:50,370`,
        `And we see an increase`,
        `in the oxidation state.`,
        
        `111`,
        `00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,111`,
        `So, it's like carbon lost electrons.`,
        
        `112`,
        `00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:56,455`,
        `Also there's a shortcut that you can use.`,
        
        `113`,
        `00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,693`,
        `For this reaction, let's think about`,
        
        `114`,
        `00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,097`,
        `what that shortcut would be.`,
        
        `115`,
        `00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:02,316`,
        `Let me use, I'll use red still.`,
        
        `116`,
        `00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:05,614`,
        `On the left, this carbon with`,
        `an oxidation state of plus one`,
        
        `117`,
        `00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,388`,
        `has two bonds to oxygen.`,
        
        `118`,
        `00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,818`,
        `Let me go ahead and highlight them here.`,
        
        `119`,
        `00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,801`,
        `So, here's one bond and`,
        `here's the other bond.`,
        
        `120`,
        `00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:13,089`,
        `On the right, that same carbon now`,
        
        `121`,
        `00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,065`,
        `has three bonds to oxygen.`,
        
        `122`,
        `00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,408`,
        `So, here's one bond, here's two bonds,`,
        
        `123`,
        `00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,150`,
        `and then this bond over here.`,
        
        `124`,
        `00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,746`,
        `So, we've increased in the`,
        `number of bonds to oxygen`,
        
        `125`,
        `00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:25,965`,
        `and that can tell us we have`,
        `an oxidation really quickly`,
        
        `126`,
        `00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:29,017`,
        `without going through and doing`,
        `all these oxidation states.`,
        
        `127`,
        `00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:31,966`,
        `Notice we lost a bond to hydrogen.`,
        
        `128`,
        `00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,925`,
        `All right, so over here we`,
        `lost this bond to hydrogen`,
        
        `129`,
        `00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:39,744`,
        `and we replaced it with a bond to oxygen.`,
        
        `130`,
        `00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:42,005`,
        `So, an increase in the`,
        `number of bonds to oxygen`,
        
        `131`,
        `00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:45,026`,
        `or a decrease in number`,
        `of bonds to hydrogen`,
        
        `132`,
        `00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:49,409`,
        `can tell you that your`,
        `carbon is oxidized too.`,
        
        `133`,
        `00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,205`,
        `Let's do another one.`,
        
        `134`,
        `00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:51,507`,
        `So, our goal is to figure out`,
        
        `135`,
        `00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:53,245`,
        `whether this starting compound has`,
        
        `136`,
        `00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:56,021`,
        `been oxidized, reduced, or neither.`,
        
        `137`,
        `00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,784`,
        `So, again, these three`,
        `carbons on the left, right,`,
        
        `138`,
        `00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:01,082`,
        `are the same as these`,
        `three carbons on the right.`,
        
        `139`,
        `00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,883`,
        `And there's no change in those carbons.`,
        
        `140`,
        `00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:04,566`,
        `So, therefore we would expect no change`,
        
        `141`,
        `00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:05,984`,
        `in the oxidation state.`,
        
        `142`,
        `00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,325`,
        `The same with this carbon.`,
        
        `143`,
        `00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,043`,
        `So, we're gonna focus in on this carbon.`,
        
        `144`,
        `00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,866`,
        `So, on the left that`,
        `carbon has a double bond`,
        
        `145`,
        `00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,909`,
        `to oxygen so we draw that in there`,
        
        `146`,
        `00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,906`,
        `an then it's bonded to`,
        `a carbon on the left`,
        
        `147`,
        `00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:19,125`,
        `and a carbon on the right.`,
        
        `148`,
        `00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,747`,
        `And our product, that same carbon,`,
        
        `149`,
        `00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,326`,
        `is now bonded to only one oxygen.`,
        
        `150`,
        `00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:25,868`,
        `Let me go ahead and do that.`,
        
        `151`,
        `00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,784`,
        `Only one bond I should say to oxygen`,
        
        `152`,
        `00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:30,197`,
        `and it's still bonded`,
        `to a carbon on the left`,
        
        `153`,
        `00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:31,881`,
        `and still bonded to a carbon on the right,`,
        
        `154`,
        `00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,820`,
        `and it must have a bond to`,
        `hydrogen in here, right?`,
        
        `155`,
        `00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,526`,
        `It's not drawn in but it's`,
        `assumed that you know that.`,
        
        `156`,
        `00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,664`,
        `So, let's put in that bond to hydrogen.`,
        
        `157`,
        `00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,957`,
        `And let's find our oxidation states.`,
        
        `158`,
        `00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,479`,
        `So, we start on the left,`,
        
        `159`,
        `00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,243`,
        `and we draw in our bonding electrons,`,
        
        `160`,
        `00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:50,782`,
        `and next we think about`,
        `electronegativity differences.`,
        
        `161`,
        `00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:54,221`,
        `So, we know that oxygen's more`,
        `electronegative than carbon`,
        
        `162`,
        `00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,541`,
        `so oxygen takes those four electrons.`,
        
        `163`,
        `00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,805`,
        `Over here, right, we assume`,
        `that the electronegativities`,
        
        `164`,
        `00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:01,544`,
        `for these carbons are the same,`,
        
        `165`,
        `00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,159`,
        `and so we split up those two electrons.`,
        
        `166`,
        `00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,063`,
        `We give on electron to one carbon`,
        
        `167`,
        `00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:07,084`,
        `and one electron to the other carbon.`,
        
        `168`,
        `00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,558`,
        `And same over here.`,
        
        `169`,
        `00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,986`,
        `So, the oxidation state for carbon`,
        
        `170`,
        `00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,839`,
        `would be four valence electrons`,
        
        `171`,
        `00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,525`,
        `minus this, in this case we have`,
        
        `172`,
        `00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:16,582`,
        `two around carbon, so here's two.`,
        
        `173`,
        `00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:20,736`,
        `Four minus two gives us an`,
        `oxidation state of plus two.`,
        
        `174`,
        `00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:22,800`,
        `So, on the left this carbon has`,
        
        `175`,
        `00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,881`,
        `an oxidation state of plus two.`,
        
        `176`,
        `00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:26,599`,
        `What about on the right?`,
        
        `177`,
        `00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,318`,
        `Let's put in our bonding electrons`,
        
        `178`,
        `00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:30,834`,
        `and again, once we've`,
        `done that we think about`,
        
        `179`,
        `00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,901`,
        `electronegativity and we can assign`,
        
        `180`,
        `00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:36,882`,
        `an oxidation state to that carbon.`,
        
        `181`,
        `00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:39,602`,
        `So, we know that oxygen's`,
        `more elecrtonegative`,
        
        `182`,
        `00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,679`,
        `so oxygen takes those two electrons.`,
        
        `183`,
        `00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,815`,
        `Right, again, there's, we assume`,
        
        `184`,
        `00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:46,518`,
        `that these carbons have`,
        `the same electronegativity`,
        
        `185`,
        `00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,101`,
        `so we split up those electrons.`,
        
        `186`,
        `00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,504`,
        `We split up these electrons.`,
        
        `187`,
        `00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:52,001`,
        `But now carbon is bonded to hydrogen.`,
        
        `188`,
        `00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,729`,
        `So, carbon is a little`,
        `more electronegative`,
        
        `189`,
        `00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,332`,
        `than hydrogen so we just give both`,
        
        `190`,
        `00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,685`,
        `of those electrons to carbon.`,
        
        `191`,
        `00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:01,233`,
        `And now let's find our oxidation state.`,
        
        `192`,
        `00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,948`,
        `We know carbon is supposed to have`,
        
        `193`,
        `00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:04,885`,
        `four valence electrons around it`,
        
        `194`,
        `00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,606`,
        `and in our drawing here, once we've`,
        
        `195`,
        `00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:08,568`,
        `accounted for electronegativity`,
        
        `196`,
        `00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:12,828`,
        `carbon is surrounded by`,
        `one, two, three, and four.`,
        
        `197`,
        `00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:16,902`,
        `So, four minus four is equal to zero.`,
        
        `198`,
        `00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:19,051`,
        `And so this carbon, this carbon now`,
        
        `199`,
        `00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,803`,
        `has an oxidation state of zero.`,
        
        `200`,
        `00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,892`,
        `So, that carbon went`,
        `from an oxidation state`,
        
        `201`,
        `00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:27,001`,
        `of plus two to an oxidation state of zero.`,
        
        `202`,
        `00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:30,102`,
        `That's a decrease in the oxidation state.`,
        
        `203`,
        `00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:32,727`,
        `So, carbon was reduced.`,
        
        `204`,
        `00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:36,883`,
        `So, in this reaction our`,
        `starting compound was reduced.`,
        
        `205`,
        `00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,900`,
        `All right, so this was, our`,
        `starting compound was reduced`,
        
        `206`,
        `00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,988`,
        `which means we would need`,
        `some sort of reducing agent`,
        
        `207`,
        `00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,960`,
        `to accomplish this reaction.`,
        
        `208`,
        `00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,444`,
        `And it's the reducing agent`,
        `that would be oxidized`,
        
        `209`,
        `00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,770`,
        `because if something is reduced`,
        
        `210`,
        `00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,942`,
        `something else has to be oxidized.`,
        
        `211`,
        `00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:56,329`,
        `We can also think about our`,
        `other definition for reduction.`,
        
        `212`,
        `00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:59,569`,
        `Gain of electrons is reduction`,
        
        `213`,
        `00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,507`,
        `and let's look at what happened here.`,
        
        `214`,
        `00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,444`,
        `So, the electrons that were gained right,`,
        
        `215`,
        `00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:05,687`,
        `were these two electrons right here`,
        
        `216`,
        `00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:07,566`,
        `because on the left we had this carbon`,
        
        `217`,
        `00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:09,229`,
        `with a double bond to this oxygen.`,
        
        `218`,
        `00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,946`,
        `On the right, we have only`,
        `now one bond to oxygen.`,
        
        `219`,
        `00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,046`,
        `Right, so we gained these two electrons`,
        
        `220`,
        `00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:17,204`,
        `because we increased the`,
        `number of bonds to hydrogen.`,
        
        `221`,
        `00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:19,045`,
        `So, our other shortcut is to look`,
        
        `222`,
        `00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:21,568`,
        `at the number of bonds to oxygen.`,
        
        `223`,
        `00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:23,566`,
        `Like we talked about in the last example.`,
        
        `224`,
        `00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:26,639`,
        `On the left, carbon has`,
        `a double bond to oxygen.`,
        
        `225`,
        `00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,566`,
        `So, two bonds to oxygen.`,
        
        `226`,
        `00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,181`,
        `On the right we have`,
        `only one bond to oxygen.`,
        
        `227`,
        `00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:34,130`,
        `So, we decreased in the`,
        `number of bonds to oxygen`,
        
        `228`,
        `00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,929`,
        `so that's a reduction.`,
        
        `229`,
        `00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:37,867`,
        `Again, a fast way of figuring it out.`,
        
        `230`,
        `00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:41,135`,
        `Or we increased an number`,
        `of bonds to hydrogen.`,
        
        `231`,
        `00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:45,763`,
        `Let's do one more of these problems.`,
        
        `232`,
        `00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:46,878`,
        `So, our goal is to figure out`,
        
        `233`,
        `00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,596`,
        `if our starting compound on the left`,
        
        `234`,
        `00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:51,335`,
        `has been oxidized, reduced, or neither.`,
        
        `235`,
        `00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:53,297`,
        `And this time these are the two carbons`,
        
        `236`,
        `00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:55,017`,
        `that we are going to analyze.`,
        
        `237`,
        `00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,530`,
        `Those are the two carbons`,
        
        `238`,
        `00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,389`,
        `that have changed in this reaction.`,
        
        `239`,
        `00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,712`,
        `So, on the left let's draw what we have.`,
        
        `240`,
        `00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:03,732`,
        `We have a carbon with a`,
        `double bond to another carbon`,
        
        `241`,
        `00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:06,488`,
        `and both of those carbons are bonded to,`,
        
        `242`,
        `00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:09,146`,
        `directly bonded to two more carbons.`,
        
        `243`,
        `00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,282`,
        `On the right, those carbons now`,
        
        `244`,
        `00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,384`,
        `only have a single bond between them`,
        
        `245`,
        `00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:15,220`,
        `and this carbon on the left`,
        
        `246`,
        `00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,682`,
        `is bonded to a hydrogen.`,
        
        `247`,
        `00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,409`,
        `This carbon on the right is`,
        `directly bonded to an oxygen`,
        
        `248`,
        `00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:21,814`,
        `and let's put in those`,
        `other carbons, right?`,
        
        `249`,
        `00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,507`,
        `We have another carbon, carbon bonds.`,
        
        `250`,
        `00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,574`,
        `I mean, let's put in those`,
        `carbon, carbon bonds like that.`,
        
        `251`,
        `00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,324`,
        `Let's assign our oxidation states.`,
        
        `252`,
        `00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:31,126`,
        `So, we draw in our bonding electrons`,
        
        `253`,
        `00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:35,329`,
        `and we think about`,
        `electronegativity differences`,
        
        `254`,
        `00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:37,752`,
        `but we're going assume once again`,
        
        `255`,
        `00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:41,909`,
        `that our carbons have the same`,
        `electronegativity on the left`,
        
        `256`,
        `00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,652`,
        `and so when we're assigning electrons`,
        
        `257`,
        `00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,728`,
        `let's just pick one of those carbons.`,
        
        `258`,
        `00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,472`,
        `So, let's pick the carbon`,
        `on the left, right?`,

        `272`,

        `273`,
        `00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:25,877`,

        `283`,

        `285`,
        `00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:55,074`,

        `286`,
        `00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:57,475`,

        `300`,

        `306`,

        `310`,
        `00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:53,628`,

        `Next, we think about the oxidation state`,
        
        `28`,
        `00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,248`,
        `for carbon, and we start with a number`,
        
        `29`,
        `00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,687`,
        `of valence electrons in the free atom,`,
        
        `30`,
        `00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,289`,
        `or the number of valence electrons`,
        
        `31`,
        `00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:07,553`,
        `that carbon is supposed to have,`,
        
        `32`,
        `00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,131`,
        `and we know carbon is supposed to have`,
        
        `33`,
        `00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:11,442`,
        `four valence electrons,`,
        
        `34`,
        `00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:13,809`,
        `so from that number,`,

        `35`,
        `00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,423`,

        `36`,
        `00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,002`,

        `38`,
        `00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,806`,

        `39`,

        `42`,
        `00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,265`,
        `about electronegativity differences,`,
        
        `43`,
        `00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,889`,
        `and we're comparing carbon to hydrogen.`,
        
        `44`,
        `00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,720`,
        `So which is more electronegative?`,
        
        `45`,
        `00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:43,461`,
        `We know that carbon is`,

        `46`,
        `00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:46,491`,
        `than hydrogen, so the two electrons`,
        
        `47`,
        `00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,348`,

        `48`,

        `49`,
        `00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,722`,
        `Carbon's going to hog those`,

        `50`,

        `52`,
        `00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,666`,
        `so it takes those electrons,`,
        
        `53`,
        `00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,801`,

        `54`,
        `00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:05,449`,

        `58`,

        `59`,
        `00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:23,862`,
        `that minus four was going`,

        `60`,
        `00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,567`,
        `for carbon.`,
        
        `61`,
        `00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,028`,
        `Let's move on to another molecule here,`,
        
        `62`,
        `00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:32,999`,
        `so C2H4, this is ethene, or ethylene.`,
        
        `63`,
        `00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,807`,
        `What's the oxidation state of carbon`,
        
        `64`,
        `00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,084`,
        `in this molecule?`,
        
        `65`,
        `00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,128`,
        `Well hydrogen should be plus one,`,
        
        `66`,
        `00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:42,843`,
        `and we have four of them`,

        `67`,
        `00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,606`,
        `So the total for carbon`,

        `68`,
        `00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:47,777`,
        `because that total has to sum to zero,`,
        
        `69`,
        `00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,262`,
        `but this time we have two carbons,`,
        
        `70`,
        `00:02:50,262 --> 00:02:52,467`,
        `so minus four divided by two`,
        
        `71`,
        `00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:55,787`,

        `73`,
        `00:02:58,864 --> 00:02:59,979`,

        `74`,
        `00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,185`,
        `let's put in our bonding electrons,`,
        
        `75`,
        `00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:05,238`,

        `76`,
        `00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:08,500`,

        `77`,
        `00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,323`,
        `So you put in our bonding electrons,`,
        
        `78`,
        `00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,517`,
        `and let's just pick one of the carbons`,
        
        `79`,
        `00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:13,886`,
        `to start off with, let's say we're talking`,
        
        `80`,
        `00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:16,243`,
        `about the carbon on the right.`,
        
        `81`,
        `00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:19,158`,
        `So we think about`,
        `electronegativity differences,`,
        
        `82`,
        `00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,001`,
        `and we know carbon is more`,
        `electronegative than hydrogen,`,
        
        `83`,
        `00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,345`,
        `so carbon's going to`,
        `steal those electrons,`,
        
        `84`,
        `00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,402`,
        `and same thing over here,`,
        
        `85`,
        `00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:28,061`,
        `carbon's more electronegative,`,
        
        `86`,
        `00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,779`,
        `so carbon steals those electrons too.`,
        
        `87`,
        `00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,566`,
        `When we get to this double bond here`,
        
        `88`,
        `00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:36,151`,
        `between the two carbons, we`,
        `have these four electrons,`,
        
        `89`,
        `00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,708`,
        `and now we're trying to`,
        `compare the electronegativity`,
        
        `90`,
        `00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,191`,
        `of carbon, to carbon, and obviously,`,
        
        `91`,
        `00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,315`,
        `that's the same electronegativity.`,
        
        `92`,
        `00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,669`,
        `So with four electrons,`,
        
        `93`,
        `00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:48,072`,
        `we're going to divide`,
        `those electrons equally,`,
        
        `94`,
        `00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:49,372`,
        `because both of those carbons`,
        
        `95`,
        `00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:52,414`,
        `have the same value for`,
        `the electronegativity`,
        
        `96`,
        `00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:53,923`,
        `and so we take those four electrons,`,
        
        `97`,
        `00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:55,108`,
        `we divide them in half,`,
        
        `98`,
        `00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,988`,
        `so we give two electrons to one carbon`,
        
        `99`,
        `00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:59,566`,

        `100`,
        `00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:02,932`,
        `So carbon normally has`,

        `101`,
        `00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,626`,
        `right, so we're using our formula here`,
        
        `102`,
        `00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,951`,

        `109`,

        `00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:25,815`,
        `five, and six, so four minus six`,
        
        `111`,
        `00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:28,195`,

        `113`,

        `00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:35,996`,
        `was supposed to have an oxidation state`,
        
        `116`,
        `00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:38,097`,
        `of minus two, so if we look over here`,
        
        `117`,
        `00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:39,897`,

        `118`,
        `00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:42,299`,

        `127`,
        `00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,275`,
        `of minus two down here.`,
        
        `128`,
        `00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,515`,
        `Hydrogen usually has an oxidation state`,
        
        `129`,
        `00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,292`,
        `of plus one, and we have two of them`,
        
        `130`,
        `00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,917`,
        `for plus two.`,
        
        `131`,
        `00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,832`,
        `This total has to sum to zero,`,
        
        `132`,
        `00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,050`,
        `so carbon should have an oxidation state`,
        
        `133`,
        `00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,254`,
        `of zero in this molecule.`,
        
        `134`,
        `00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,076`,
        `And let's go ahead and`,
        `look at the dot structure.`,
        
        `135`,
        `00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:23,478`,
        `We put in all of our bonding electrons,`,
        
        `136`,
        `00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:26,393`,
        `so we can find the oxidation state easier,`,
        
        `137`,
        `00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,515`,
        `and we think about`,
        `electronegativity differences.`,
        
        `138`,
        `00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,139`,
        `We know carbon's more`,
        `electronegative than hydrogen`,
        
        `139`,
        `00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,440`,
        `so carbon takes those electrons.`,
        
        `140`,
        `00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,424`,
        `Same for this bond, carbon`,
        `takes those electrons.`,
        
        `141`,
        `00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,395`,
        `But now, now we're going to compare carbon`,
        
        `142`,
        `00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:44,970`,
        `to oxygen, and we know oxygen`,
        `is more electronegative`,
        
        `143`,
        `00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,536`,
        `than carbon, so oxygen's going to take`,
        
        `144`,
        `00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,997`,
        `all of those electrons, so all four`,
        
        `145`,
        `00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:52,656`,
        `of those electrons in that double bond.`,
        
        `146`,
        `00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,012`,
        `So it's winner takes all`,
        `when you're thinking about`,
        
        `147`,
        `00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:56,893`,
        `oxidation states.`,
        
        `148`,
        `00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,238`,
        `So because oxygen is more electronegative,`,
        
        `149`,
        `00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:01,293`,
        `it takes all of those electrons,`,
        
        `150`,
        `00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:03,220`,
        `and now we can see that`,
        `carbon is surrounded`,
        
        `151`,
        `00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,552`,
        `by four electrons, so one, two,`,
        
        `152`,
        `00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,292`,
        `three, four, carbon is supposed`,
        
        `153`,
        `00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,090`,
        `to have four valence electrons around it,`,
        
        `154`,
        `00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,655`,
        `and here we see it is surrounded by four`,
        
        `155`,
        `00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:17,453`,
        `and once we take into`,
        `account electronegativity,`,
        
        `156`,
        `00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:20,575`,
        `so four minus four gives`,
        `us an oxidation state`,
        
        `157`,
        `00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:24,477`,
        `of zero, so in the formaldehyde molecule,`,
        
        `158`,
        `00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:27,089`,
        `carbon has an oxidation state of zero,`,
        
        `159`,
        `00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,969`,
        `which is what we predicted over here.`,
        
        `160`,
        `00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,397`,
        `Let's think about oxygen.`,
        
        `161`,
        `00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:33,335`,
        `We said that oxygen would`,
        `have an oxidation state`,
        
        `162`,
        `00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:36,330`,
        `of minus two, so let's look at oxygen,`,
        
        `163`,
        `00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,570`,
        `oxygen is right here.`,
        
        `164`,
        `00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,067`,
        `Let's think about how`,
        `many valence electrons`,
        
        `165`,
        `00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,087`,
        `oxygen should have.`,
        
        `166`,
        `00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,896`,
        `Well, because of it's position`,
        `on the periodic table,`,
        
        `167`,
        `00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:48,554`,
        `oxygen should have six valence electrons.`,
        
        `168`,
        `00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,272`,
        `How many electrons are around it now,`,
        
        `169`,
        `00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:53,837`,
        `once we've accounted`,
        `for electronegativity?`,
        
        `170`,
        `00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:57,587`,
        `Well, here's one, two, three, four,`,
        
        `171`,
        `00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:01,034`,
        `five, six, seven, and eight.`,
        
        `172`,
        `00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:04,147`,
        `So six minus eight gives`,
        `us an oxidation state`,
        
        `173`,
        `00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:06,852`,
        `for oxygen of minus two.`,
        
        `174`,
        `00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:09,207`,
        `What about for hydrogen?`,
        
        `175`,
        `00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:13,806`,
        `So hydrogen should have`,
        `one valence electron,`,
        
        `176`,
        `00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:16,267`,
        `but there's zero electrons around it here`,
        
        `177`,
        `00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,786`,
        `because carbon's more`,
        `electronegative than hydrogen,`,
        
        `178`,
        `00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:21,770`,
        `so one minus zero gives`,
        `us an oxidation state`,
        
        `179`,
        `00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,450`,
        `of plus one, which is what`,
        `we predicted over here,`,
        
        `180`,
        `00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,551`,
        `and the same thing for this hydrogen.`,
        
        `181`,
        `00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:31,474`,
        `So this formula works for other atoms too.`,
        
        `182`,
        `00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:34,435`,
        `All right, let's do another example,`,
        
        `183`,
        `00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,873`,
        `and this time we're doing formic acid,`,
        
        `184`,
        `00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,873`,
        `so CH2O2, oxygen should be minus two,`,
        
        `185`,
        `00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:43,563`,
        `and we have two of them,`,
        
        `186`,
        `00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,604`,
        `so we have minus four`,
        `for totaling our oxygens.`,
        
        `187`,
        `00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:48,264`,
        `Hydrogen should be plus one,`,
        
        `188`,
        `00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:51,945`,
        `and we have two of them`,
        `for a total of plus two,`,
        
        `189`,
        `00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:54,126`,
        `and now, this total has`,
        `to (mumbles) equal zero.`,
        
        `190`,
        `00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:56,563`,
        `So we know that carbon's oxidation state`,
        
        `191`,
        `00:07:56,563 --> 00:08:01,103`,
        `should be plus two in the`,
        `formic acid molecule here.`,
        
        `192`,
        `00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:05,003`,
        `So let's go over and put`,
        `in our bonding electrons,`,
        
        `193`,
        `00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:07,721`,
        `so we put in all of our`,
        `bonding electrons here,`,
        
        `194`,
        `00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:11,703`,
        `and we think about the`,
        `oxidation state of carbon,`,
        
        `195`,
        `00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:14,301`,
        `we think about electronegativities.`,
        
        `196`,
        `00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:16,857`,
        `So carbon is more`,
        `electronegative than hydrogen,`,
        
        `197`,
        `00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:19,759`,
        `so carbon gets those two`,
        `electrons in that bond,`,
        
        `198`,
        `00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,174`,
        `but over here, oxygen`,
        `is more electronegative`,
        
        `199`,
        `00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:25,181`,
        `than carbon, so oxygen`,
        `takes those electrons,`,
        
        `200`,
        `00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,561`,
        `and the same thing above,`,
        
        `201`,
        `00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:28,420`,
        `oxygen is more`,
        `electronegative than carbon,`,
        
        `202`,
        `00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,835`,
        `so oxygen takes those electrons too.`,
        
        `203`,
        `00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:33,284`,
        `So what's the oxidation state of carbon`,
        
        `204`,
        `00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:35,082`,
        `in formic acid?`,
        
        `205`,
        `00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,044`,
        `Well, carbon is supposed to`,
        `have four valence electrons,`,
        
        `206`,
        `00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,761`,
        `and from that we subtract the number`,
        
        `207`,
        `00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,560`,
        `of electrons around carbon,`,
        
        `208`,
        `00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,640`,
        `once we've accounted`,
        `for electronegativity.`,
        
        `209`,
        `00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,438`,
        `Once we pretend like everything is ionic,`,
        
        `210`,
        `00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,760`,
        `and that's only two electrons this time,`,
        
        `211`,
        `00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,801`,
        `so four minus two gives`,
        `us an oxidation state`,
        
        `212`,
        `00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,041`,
        `for carbon of plus two,`,
        `just like we predicted`,
        
        `213`,
        `00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,259`,
        `over here.`,
        
        `214`,
        `00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,372`,
        `So you can see every molecule we've done`,
        
        `215`,
        `00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,659`,
        `so far, has had a`,

        `216`,

        `for carbon, carbon is unique,`,
        
        `217`,

        `it has all these different`,

        `218`,

        `219`,
        `00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,664`,
        `So oxygen should have an oxidation state`,
        
        `220`,
        `00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:15,310`,

        `222`,
        `00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,408`,
        `so carbon must have an oxidation state`,

        `56`,

        `57`,

        `65`,
        `00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,990`,

        `75`,

        `of distance, I guess you could`,

        `76`,
        `00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,223`,
        `So this right here`,

        `77`,
        `00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,640`,
        `So the correct thing`,

        `moved a distance of 5 meters.`,
        
        `81`,
        `00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,820`,
        `Distance is a scalar`,

        `82`,

        `86`,
        `00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,740`,
        `well, we'll talk about the`,

        `87`,
        `00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,290`,
        `So let's say that this`,

        `88`,
        `00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,684`,

        `89`,
        `00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:35,350`,
        `let me just, because`,

        `90`,
        `00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,599`,

        `91`,
        `00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:41,390`,
        `So let's say that the`,
        `change in time right here,`,
        
        `92`,
        `00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,919`,
        `when I moved this`,

        `93`,
        `00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,100`,
        `let's say that it`,

        `94`,
        `00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,420`,
        `let's say that the change`,

        `95`,
        `00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,190`,
        `So maybe right when the`,

        `96`,
        `00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,400`,
        `on my stopwatch it said 0.`,
        
        `97`,
        `00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,340`,
        `And then on my stopwatch`,
        `when it stopped moving,`,
        
        `98`,
        `00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,210`,
        `it said, or when it`,
        `got to this position,`,
        
        `99`,
        `00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,168`,
        `I should say-- when it`,
        `left from this position,`,
        
        `100`,
        `00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,580`,
        `my stopwatch said 0.`,
        
        `101`,

        `When it got to this position`,
        `my stopwatch said 2 seconds.`,
        
        `102`,
        `00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800`,
        `So the change in time, or the`,
        `duration we're dealing with,`,
        
        `103`,
        `00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,446`,
        `is 2 seconds.`,
        
        `104`,
        `00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,070`,
        `And this is, for all`,
        `we know, time only`,
        
        `105`,
        `00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,550`,

        `106`,
        `00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,159`,
        `So you could assume`,
        `that it's, you`,
        
        `107`,
        `00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,200`,
        `could pick that as a vector`,

        `108`,
        `00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,740`,
        `I guess, because there's`,
        `only one direction for time,`,
        
        `109`,
        `00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,320`,
        `as far as we know, or`,
        `at least in what we're`,
        
        `110`,
        `00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,070`,
        `going to deal with for`,
        `the simple physics.`,
        
        `111`,
        `00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,000`,
        `So what is a measure of`,
        `how fast this thing moved?`,
        
        `112`,
        `00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,320`,
        `So, how fast did`,
        `this thing move?`,
        
        `113`,
        `00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,430`,
        `So we could say it moved`,
        `5 meters in 2 seconds.`,
        
        `114`,
        `00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,460`,
        `Let me write this down.`,
        
        `115`,
        `00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,310`,
        `So it moved 5 meters`,

        `116`,
        `00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,820`,
        `Or we could write this as`,
        `5/2 of a meter per second.`,
        
        `117`,
        `00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,180`,
        `Or 5 divided by 2 is what?`,
        
        `118`,
        `00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,230`,
        `5 divided by 2 is 2.5`,

        `120`,

        `let me make that clear.`,
        
        `121`,
        `00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,230`,

        `122`,
        `00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,300`,
        `So my question to you.`,
        
        `123`,
        `00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,450`,

        `125`,

        `126`,

        `127`,

        `128`,
        `00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,090`,
        `Or is it also giving`,

        `129`,

        `Well, I don't see`,

        `130`,
        `00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,700`,
        `So this is a scalar quantity.`,
        
        `131`,
        `00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,469`,

        `132`,

        `133`,
        `00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,100`,
        `So we could say that`,

        `134`,

        `what do we get?`,
        
        `139`,
        `00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,860`,

        `141`,
        `00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,220`,
        `So is this a vector`,

        `142`,

        `143`,

        `144`,
        `00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,760`,

        `145`,
        `00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,909`,

        `147`,

        `148`,
        `00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,080`,

        `15`,
        `00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,030`,
        `so maybe it has something`,

        `16`,
        `00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,250`,
        `And it says hydrates,`,

        `17`,
        `00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,470`,
        `so maybe it has something`,

        `18`,
        `00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,960`,

        `19`,
        `00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,590`,
        `because carbohydrates do involve carbons.`,

        `20`,
        `00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,710`,
        `In fact, this is a very`,

        `21`,
        `00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,310`,
        `a very simple one right over here.`,

        `22`,
        `00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,350`,
        `This is a glucose molecule.`,

        `23`,
        `00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,540`,
        `And in gray, you see`,
        `that it has six carbons.`,

        `24`,
        `00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,800`,
        `And the hydrate part refers to,`,

        `25`,
        `00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,349`,
        `that carbohydrates typically`,
        `have oxygen to hydrogens`,

        `26`,
        `00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,940`,
        `in the same ratio as you`,
        `would expect in water.`,

        `27`,
        `00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,379`,
        `So, for every one oxygen, two hydrogens,`,

        `28`,
        `00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,959`,
        `and you see that right over here,`,

        `29`,
        `00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,649`,
        `where in glucose, you have one, two,`,

        `30`,
        `00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,450`,
        `three, four, five, six oxygens`,

        `31`,
        `00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,870`,
        `and you have 12 hydrogens,`,

        `32`,
        `00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,320`,
        `and so that's where this word comes from.`,

        `33`,
        `00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,669`,
        `Now, another word that is often used`,

        `34`,
        `00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,142`,
        `interchangeably with carbohydrates`,
        `is the term saccharide.`,

        `35`,
        `00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:25,780`,
        `Saccharide, and saccharide`,
        `comes from Greek for sweet,`,

        `36`,
        `00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,650`,
        `and that makes sense because`,
        `if you were to taste glucose,`,

        `37`,
        `00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,290`,
        `it would taste sweet to you.`,

        `38`,
        `00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,920`,
        `Now, what's interesting`,
        `about something like glucose`,

        `39`,
        `00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,970`,
        `is glucose can be a standalone molecule,`,

        `40`,
        `00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,730`,
        `a very simple sugar in this case`,

        `41`,
        `00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,630`,
        `or you can build up larger molecules`,

        `42`,
        `00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,229`,
        `with really glucose as a building block.`,

        `43`,
        `00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,340`,
        `So for example, right over here,`,

        `44`,
        `00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,260`,
        `we have a part of a glycogen molecule.`,

        `45`,
        `00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,093`,
        `And as you can see,`,

        `46`,
        `00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,600`,
        `it's just a repeating`,
        `sequence of glucose molecules.`,

        `47`,
        `00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,320`,
        `And so, something like this,`,

        `48`,
        `00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,300`,
        `we would call glucose a monosaccharide.`,

        `49`,
        `00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,440`,
        `It's one simple sugar right over here.`,

        `50`,
        `00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,399`,
        `Monosaccharide.`,

        `51`,
        `00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,800`,
        `And we would call this`,
        `glycogen a polysaccharide.`,

        `52`,
        `00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,160`,
        `Polysaccharide.`,

        `53`,
        `00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,620`,
        `Or another way to think about it`,

        `54`,
        `00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,560`,
        `is glucose is the building`,
        `block for the glycogen.`,

        `55`,
        `00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,070`,
        `Another term you might see`,
        `is monomer and polymer.`,

        `56`,
        `00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,329`,
        `Those are the general terms`,

        `57`,
        `00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,250`,
        `or if I'm building a large molecule`,

        `58`,
        `00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,380`,
        `out of a chain of smaller ones,`,

        `59`,
        `00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,370`,
        `the building blocks, we`,
        `consider to be monomers,`,

        `60`,
        `00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,220`,
        `and then the thing that we`,
        `build out of those monomers`,

        `61`,
        `00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,520`,
        `could be our polymer.`,

        `62`,
        `00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,680`,
        `And as we'll see, this`,
        `monomer polymer phenomenon`,

        `63`,
        `00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,830`,
        `is not limited to`,
        `carbohydrates or saccharides.`,

        `64`,
        `00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,080`,
        `We're gonna see that same`,
        `relationship, for example,`,

        `65`,
        `00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,410`,
        `between amino acids and proteins.`,

        `66`,
        `00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,010`,
        `Now, what role do carbohydrates play`,

        `67`,
        `00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,130`,
        `inside of biological systems?`,

        `68`,
        `00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,359`,
        `Well, saccharides or carbohydrates`,

        `69`,
        `00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,330`,
        `are often associated`,
        `with the source energy.`,

        `70`,
        `00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,060`,
        `Glucose can be converted`,

        `71`,
        `00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,970`,
        `very quickly to energy`,
        `in biological cells.`,

        `72`,
        `00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,720`,

        `76`,
        `00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:20,520`,
        `is a very readily`,

        `78`,
        `00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,530`,
        `could also play a structural role`,

        `79`,
        `00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,220`,

        `to be an acid or base`,

        `45`,

        `00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,846`,

        `In fact, even soap is quite basic.`,

        `64`,
        `00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,498`,
        `And of the basic things`,
        `that you could eat,`,

        `65`,
        `00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:07,755`,
        `you might have a bitter`,

        `66`,
        `00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,941`,
        `But to be clear, I really don't recommend`,

        `67`,
        `00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,494`,
        `eating or drinking anything`,
        `that is either highly basic`,

        `68`,
        `00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,940`,
        `or highly acidic, and the reason is`,

        `69`,
        `00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,143`,
        `is that things that are at`,

        `70`,
        `00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:22,233`,
        `so things that are either extremely basic`,

        `71`,
        `00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,150`,
        `or things that are extremely acidic`,

        `72`,
        `00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:29,321`,

        `73`,
        `00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,807`,
        `because they're so reactive,`,
        `they will damage you.`,

        `74`,

        `77`,
        `00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,507`,
        `So don't try to taste things to see`,

        `79`,
        `00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,012`,

        `81`,
        `00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,259`,
        `So I've talked a lot about`,
        `things that are acidic`,

        `82`,
        `00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,587`,
        `or basic, but also what's interesting`,

        `83`,
        `00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:57,215`,
        `is things that we consider to be neutral.`,

        `84`,
        `00:03:57,216 --> 00:04:00,386`,
        `So our blood, for`,
        `example, is quite neutral,`,

        `85`,
        `00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,763`,
        `and this is something`,
        `that doctors might measure`,

        `86`,
        `00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:05,750`,
        `because if your pH in your`,
        `blood gets a little bit too high`,

        `87`,
        `00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,583`,
        `or a little bit too low,`,

        `88`,
        `00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,704`,
        `that can cause some serious problems.`,

        `89`,
        `00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:11,735`,
        `Sea water is pretty`,
        `close to being neutral.`,

        `90`,
        `00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:15,006`,
        `Milk is not that far off of being neutral.`,

        `91`,
        `00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,064`,
        `Now with that said, in order to read`,

        `92`,
        `00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:20,004`,
        `the pH scale appropriately`,
        `or appreciate the differences`,

        `93`,
        `00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,011`,
        `in acidity and basicity,`,
        `it's important to realize`,

        `94`,
        `00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:25,255`,
        `that it is not a linear scale.`,

        `95`,
        `00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:28,851`,
        `So for example, something`,
        `that has a pH of eight`,

        `96`,
        `00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:33,319`,
        `is not twice as basic as`,
        `something that has a pH of four.`,

        `97`,
        `00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,290`,
        `It turns out, when you go`,
        `form one level of our pH scale`,

        `98`,
        `00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,265`,
        `to the other, you are`,
        `going up in basicity,`,

        `99`,
        `00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:42,098`,
        `say going from a pH four to a pH of five,`,

        `100`,
        `00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,610`,
        `by a factor of 10.`,

        `101`,
        `00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,671`,
        `And so, comparing`,
        `something with a pH of four`,

        `102`,
        `00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,819`,
        `to a pH of eight, that`,
        `thing with the pH of four`,

        `103`,
        `00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,819`,
        `would be 10, 100, 1,000,`,

        `104`,
        `00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,934`,
        `10,000 times more acidic,`,

        `105`,
        `00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:56,009`,
        `or you could say the`,
        `thing with a pH of eight`,

        `106`,
        `00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,509`,

        `107`,
        `00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,822`,
        `10,000 times more basic.`,

        `108`,
        `00:05:02,276 --> 00:05:03,556`,

        `37`,
        `00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:43,337`,
        `these are fat soluble.`,

        `38`,
        `00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,375`,
        `What does that mean?`,

        `39`,
        `00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,044`,
        `Well, to be soluble means you could be`,

        `40`,
        `00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,146`,
        `dissolved in that thing.`,

        `42`,
        `00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,691`,
        `And Vitamin C is water soluble.`,

        `00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:57,429`,
        `Now the reason why this`,

        `44`,
        `00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,617`,
        `living as an individual,`,

        `45`,
        `00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:03,054`,
        `in good shape, is that you do`,
        `need all of these vitamins,`,

        `46`,
        `00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:05,440`,

        `bit about why you need them,`,

        `47`,
        `00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,038`,
        `but fat soluble vitamins,`,
        `they're actually easier`,

        `48`,
        `00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,655`,
        `to overdose on, because`,
        `they're soluble in fat,`,

        `49`,
        `00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,548`,
        `they can stay in your system a lot longer,`,

        `50`,
        `00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:15,007`,
        `while water soluble vitamins are easier`,

        `51`,
        `00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,532`,
        `to flush out of your system.`,

        `52`,
        `00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,270`,
        `Now, with that out of the`,
        `way, let's think about some`,

        `53`,
        `00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,271`,
        `of these common foods you might see,`,

        `54`,
        `00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,989`,
        `and some of the vitamins`,
        `that they are known for.`,

        `55`,
        `00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,306`,
        `For example, right over`,

        `56`,
        `00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:28,634`,
        `and you might have had people tell you,`,

        `57`,
        `00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:29,573`,
        `"Hey, eat carrots.`,

        `58`,
        `00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:31,066`,
        `"It's good for your eyes."`,

        `59`,
        `00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,887`,
        `And that is true, but the reason why`,

        `60`,
        `00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:33,834`,
        `it's good for your eyes,`,

        `61`,
        `00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:38,409`,
        `is that carrots contain`,
        `something known as betacarotene,`,

        `62`,
        `00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,534`,
        `and the carotene part of`,
        `betacarotene is not a coincidence.`,

        `63`,
        `00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:45,156`,
        `It literally comes from Latin for carrot,`,

        `64`,
        `00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,754`,
        `and carotenes are these pigment molecules.`,

        `65`,
        `00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:50,489`,
        `It gives the carrot this`,
        `orange color right over here,`,

        `66`,
        `00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,826`,
        `and betacarotene, once`,
        `it's consumed by your body,`,

        `67`,
        `00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:56,409`,
        `it's a precursor for Vitamin A,`,

        `68`,
        `00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,583`,
        `which is essential for your eyes`,

        `69`,
        `00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:02,021`,
        `and many, many other things in your body.`,

        `70`,
        `00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,517`,
        `And a precursor's just a`,
        `very fancy way of saying`,

        `71`,
        `00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,263`,
        `that if you consume`,
        `betacarotene, you're body can`,

        `72`,
        `00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:11,690`,
        `turn it into the Vitamin A that it needs.`,

        `73`,
        `00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,108`,
        `Oranges, famous for`,
        `Vitamin C, and this isn't`,

        `74`,
        `00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,921`,
        `an exhaustive list of things`,
        `that these foods contain,`,

        `75`,
        `00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,537`,
        `but this is some of the things`,
        `that they're most famous for,`,

        `76`,
        `00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:24,330`,
        `and Vitamin C as we talked about`,
        `is a water soluble vitamin.`,

        `77`,
        `00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,878`,
        `It's very valuable for immune system,`,

        `78`,
        `00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,590`,
        `and in a situation where`,
        `you have a severe deficiency`,

        `79`,
        `00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:34,430`,
        `of Vitamin C, you could get`,
        `a disease known as scurvy.`,

        `80`,
        `00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,148`,
        `And scurvy is not too common`,
        `anymore, but several hundred`,

        `81`,
        `00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:40,019`,
        `years ago, sailors would`,
        `often get scurvy because`,

        `82`,
        `00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,483`,
        `they had very limited diets.`,

        `83`,
        `00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,470`,
        `They did not get fruits and vegetables,`,

        `84`,
        `00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,792`,
        `and because of that Vitamin C deficiency,`,

        `85`,
        `00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,412`,
        `their collagen, their connective`,
        `tissue would break down.`,

        `86`,
        `00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:52,841`,
        `So it was a very horrible`,
        `and painful disease.`,

        `87`,
        `00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,472`,
        `But what if there's`,
        `something your body needs`,

        `88`,
        `00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:57,220`,
        `that it does not produce`,
        `that is not organic?`,

        `89`,
        `00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,508`,
        `Well those are the things`,
        `that we call minerals.`,

        `90`,
        `00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,392`,
        `And, of course, the term`,
        `minerals, it's also used`,

        `91`,
        `00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,399`,
        `in a geological sense, but`,
        `if were talking in terms`,

        `92`,
        `00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,426`,
        `of biology, that's what we mean.`,

        `93`,
        `00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:10,977`,
        `And most of the typical`,
        `minerals are really elements`,

        `94`,
        `00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:13,660`,
        `that you will see on the periodic table.`,

        `95`,
        `00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,302`,
        `They will be things like phosphorous,`,

        `96`,
        `00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:19,023`,
        `and I'm just gonna write`,
        `their element symbol.`,

        `97`,
        `00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:23,106`,
        `Phosphorous, calcium,`,
        `potassium, magnesium, iron,`,

        `98`,
        `00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,987`,
        `and again, this is not an exhaustive list,`,

        `99`,
        `00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,886`,
        `but these are all essential for your body.`,

        `100`,
        `00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:33,776`,
        `As we go further in our study of biology,`,

        `101`,
        `00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:36,207`,
        `you will see how phosphorous is useful`,

        `102`,
        `00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,658`,
        `in molecules like ATP, the energy store.`,

        `103`,
        `00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:43,829`,
        `It's even in the backbone of DNA and RNA.`,

        `104`,
        `00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,836`,
        `We'll see how calcium is`,
        `useful, not just for your bones,`,

        `105`,
        `00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:50,365`,
        `but even for things like`,
        `muscle contractions.`,

        `106`,
        `00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:53,308`,
        `To send signals down`,
        `neurons, you're going to need`,

        `107`,
        `00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:55,598`,
        `your potassium and also sodium.`,

        `108`,
        `00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:59,257`,
        `Magnesium, also important`,
        `for muscle contraction.`,

        `109`,
        `00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,840`,
        `Iron, this is in your`,
        `hemoglobin, bonds to the oxygen,`,

        `110`,
        `00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,429`,
        `allows you to transport`,
        `oxygen in your bloodstream`,

        `111`,
        `00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,875`,
        `and red blood cells.`,

        `112`,
        `00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,001`,
        `So these are all very valuable.`,

        `113`,
        `00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,126`,
        `And a lot of those foods`,
        `that we just talked about`,

        `114`,
        `00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,400`,
        `that contain vitamins,`,
        `they'll also contain minerals.`,

        `115`,
        `00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,969`,
        `For example, not only do`,
        `carrots contain betacarotene,`,

        `116`,
        `00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,627`,
        `they also contain potassium,`,
        `which we mentioned`,

        `117`,
        `00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:27,079`,
        `is essential for things`,
        `like nerve function.`,

        `118`,
        `00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,340`,
        `Things like milk, it has`,
        `vitamins, like Vitamin D,`,

        `119`,
        `00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,287`,
        `but it also has minerals like calcium,`,

        `120`,
        `00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,581`,
        `which we talked about as`,
        `essential for your bones`,

        `121`,
        `00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,729`,
        `and for muscle function.`,

        `122`,
        `00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,200`,
        `And so the big picture here is,`,

        `123`,
        `00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,760`,
        `is that vitamins and`,
        `minerals are both things`,

        `124`,
        `00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:44,661`,
        `that your body needs, that`,
        `it does not produce itself,`,

        `125`,
        `00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,245`,
        `and we're going to see them`,
        `over and over again in biology.`,

        `126`,
        `00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:48,887`,
        `So keep a lookout for them.`,

        `127`,
        `00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:51,394`,
        `The vitamins as we go further`,

        `129`,
        `00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:56,330`,
        `things that help facilitate`,

        `130`,
        `00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,825`,
        `help facilitate reactions and the minerals`,

        `131`,
        `00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,442`,
        `you're going to see in`,

        `132`,

        `00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:08,787`,
        `You're gonna see it in hemoglobin.`,

        `11`,
        `00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,940`,

        `17`,
        `00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,007`,
        `So those are the terms.`,

        `18`,
        `00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,589`,
        `Now let's think about`,

        `21`,
        `00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,960`,

        `22`,
        `00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,900`,
        `So over here, the x`,

        `23`,
        `00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,815`,
        `That's being multiplied by 3.`,

        `24`,
        `00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:05,179`,
        `So 3 is the coefficient`,

        `25`,
        `00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,460`,

        `27`,
        `00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,490`,
        `It's a negative 8.`,

        `28`,

        `It's negative 8`,

        `29`,
        `00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,699`,
        `So that's the coefficient`,

        `30`,
        `00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,270`,
        `And here you might`,
        `say, hey wait,`,

        `31`,
        `00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,580`,
        `nothing is multiplying x here.`,

        `32`,
        `00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,429`,

        `35`,
        `00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,559`,
        `But you can think of this as 7`,

        `36`,
        `00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,310`,
        `because we know that x to the`,

        `37`,
        `00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,890`,
        `So we would even call`,
        `this constant, the 7,`,

        `38`,
        `00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,490`,
        `this would be the`,
        `coefficient on 7x to the 0.`,

        `39`,
        `00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,660`,
        `So you could view`,

        `00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,104`,
        `So this is also a coefficient.`,

        `41`,
        `00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:53,393`,
        `So let me make it clear, these`,
        `three things are coefficients.`,

        `42`,
        `00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,030`,

        `44`,
        `00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,180`,
        `So the exponent of`,
        `this first term is 2.`,

        `45`,
        `00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,120`,

        `00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,160`,
        `The exponent of the second`,

        `47`,
        `00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,810`,
        `is the same thing as`,

        `48`,
        `00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,920`,

        `49`,
        `00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,519`,
        `And then on this last`,
        `term, we already said,`,

        `50`,
        `00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,230`,

        `51`,
        `00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,560`,
        `So the exponent here on the`,

        `52`,
        `00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,780`,
        `So these things right over`,

        `23`,
        `00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,420`,

        `24`,

        `39`,
        `00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,600`,
        `And that's the only`,

        `40`,
        `00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600`,

        `42`,

        `It's not be multiplied by x.`,

        `43`,
        `00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,590`,
