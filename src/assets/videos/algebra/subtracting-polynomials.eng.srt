1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,510
Simplify 16x plus 14 minus
the entire expression 3x

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,340
squared plus x minus 9.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,510
So when you subtract
an entire expression,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,329
this is the exact same
thing as having 16x plus 14.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,280
And then you're adding the
opposite of this whole thing.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,680
Or you're adding
negative 1 times 3x

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,485
squared plus x minus 9.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,110
Or another way to
think about it is you

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,450
can distribute this negative
sign along all of those terms.

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,760
That's essentially what
we're about to do here.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,449
We're just adding the
negative of this entire thing.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,061
We're adding the opposite of it.

13
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,060
So this first part-- I'm
not going to change it.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,710
That's still just 16x plus 14.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,310
But now I'm going to distribute
the negative sign here.

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:52,780
So negative 1 times 3x squared
is negative 3x squared.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,690
Negative 1 times
positive x is negative

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,169
x because that's positive 1x.

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,174
Negative 1 times
negative 9-- remember,

20
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:04,340
you have to consider this
negative right over there.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,960
That is part of the term.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,470
Negative 1 times
negative 9 is positive 9.

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,070
Negative times a
negative is a positive.

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,240
So then we have positive 9.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,255
And now we just have
to combine like terms.

26
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:17,880
So what's our highest
degree term here?

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,253
I like to write
it in that order.

28
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:22,487
We have only one x squared
term, second-degree term.

29
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:23,570
We only have one of those.

30
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,610
So let me write it over
here-- negative 3x squared.

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,050
And then what do we have in
terms of first-degree terms,

32
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,970
of just an x, x to
the first power?

33
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,070
Well, we have a 16x.

34
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,710
And then from that, we're going
to subtract an x, subtract 1x.

35
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,820
So 16x minus 1x is 15x.

36
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,470
If you have 16 of something and
you subtract 1 of them away,

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,460
you're going to have
15 of that something.

38
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,369
And then finally, you have 14.

39
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,866
You could view that as 14
times x to the 0 or just 14.

40
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,380
14 plus 9-- they're
both constant terms,

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,530
or they're both being
multiplied by x to the 0.

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,325
14 plus 9 is 23.

43
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:01,950
And we're done.

44
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,071
Negative 3x squared
plus 15x plus 23.
