00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:05.687 align:middle line:90%
- [Sal] Let's explore the
notion of a polynomial.

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:07.677 align:middle line:84%
This seems like a very complicated word,

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:09.464 align:middle line:90%
but if you break it down
it'll start to make sense,

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.285 align:middle line:90%
especially when we start to
see examples of polynomials.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:15.440 align:middle line:84%
The first part of this word,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.791 align:middle line:84%
lemme underline it, we have poly.

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:20.621 align:middle line:84%
This comes from Greek, for many.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.913 align:middle line:90%
You see poly a lot in
the English language,

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.432 align:middle line:90%
referring to the notion
of many of something.

00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:29.282 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's many nomials.

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:33.631 align:middle line:90%
Nomial comes from Latin, from
the Latin nomen, for name.

00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.271 align:middle line:84%
You could view this as many names.

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.897 align:middle line:84%
But in a mathematical context,

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:40.298 align:middle line:84%
it's really referring to many terms.

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:41.882 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna talk, in a little bit,

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
about what a term really is.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.207 align:middle line:90%
But to get a tangible sense
of what are polynomials

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:50.378 align:middle line:90%
and what are not polynomials,
lemme give you some examples.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:51.959 align:middle line:84%
And then we could write some, maybe,

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:54.313 align:middle line:84%
more formal rules for them.

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:57.771 align:middle line:84%
So, an example of a polynomial could be

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:02.862 align:middle line:90%
10x to the seventh power
minus nine x squared

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:07.419 align:middle line:84%
plus 15x to the third plus nine.

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:09.492 align:middle line:84%
This is a polynomial.

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:11.686 align:middle line:84%
Another example of a polynomial.

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:16.721 align:middle line:84%
Nine a squared minus five.

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.549 align:middle line:84%
Even if I just have one number,

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.843 align:middle line:90%
even if I were to just
write the number six,

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:24.973 align:middle line:90%
that can officially be
considered a polynomial.

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:30.183 align:middle line:90%
If I were to write seven
x squared minus three.

00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:31.118 align:middle line:84%
Lemme do it another variable.

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:36.042 align:middle line:84%
Seven y squared minus three y plus pi,

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that, too, would be a polynomial.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.356 align:middle line:84%
These are examples of polynomials.

00:01:40.356 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:90%
What are examples of things
that are not polynomials?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.078 align:middle line:90%
Well, if I were to
replace the seventh power

00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:50.151 align:middle line:90%
right over here with a
negative seven power.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.964 align:middle line:90%
If I were to write 10x to
the negative seven power

00:01:53.964 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:90%
minus nine x squared plus 15x
to the third power plus nine,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.418 align:middle line:84%
this would not be a polynomial.

00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:04.249 align:middle line:90%
So I think you might
be sensing a rule here

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.133 align:middle line:84%
for what makes something a polynomial.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:09.201 align:middle line:84%
You have to have nonnegative powers

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
of your variable in each of the terms.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.524 align:middle line:90%
I just used that word,
terms, so lemme explain it,

00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:17.246 align:middle line:90%
'cause it'll help me explain
what a polynomial is.

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:22.079 align:middle line:90%
A polynomial is something that
is made up of a sum of terms.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.332 align:middle line:90%
And so, for example, in
this first polynomial,

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:27.931 align:middle line:84%
the first term is 10x to the seventh;

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:31.344 align:middle line:90%
the second term is
negative nine x squared;

00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:33.781 align:middle line:84%
the next term is 15x to the third;

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and then the last term,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.561 align:middle line:90%
maybe you could say the
fourth term, is nine.

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.691 align:middle line:84%
You can see something.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.918 align:middle line:84%
Let me underline these.

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:42.623 align:middle line:84%
These are all terms.

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:46.811 align:middle line:90%
This is a four-term
polynomial right over here.

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:48.637 align:middle line:90%
You could say: "Hey, wait,
this thing you wrote in red,

00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:50.304 align:middle line:84%
"this also has four terms."

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to put a few more rules for it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
to officially be a polynomial,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.873 align:middle line:84%
especially a polynomial in one variable.

00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:57.296 align:middle line:84%
Each of those terms are going

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:00.102 align:middle line:84%
to be made up of a coefficient.

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:01.973 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing that multiplies

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.492 align:middle line:84%
the variable to some power.

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:07.641 align:middle line:90%
So in this first term
the coefficient is 10.

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.606 align:middle line:84%
Lemme write this word down, coefficient.

00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It's another fancy word,
but it's just a thing

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.706 align:middle line:84%
that's multiplied, in this case,

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:17.518 align:middle line:90%
times the variable, which
is x to seventh power.

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:19.488 align:middle line:84%
The first coefficient is 10.

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:20.708 align:middle line:84%
The next coefficient.

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:22.543 align:middle line:84%
Actually, lemme be careful here,

00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:27.653 align:middle line:90%
because the second coefficient
here is negative nine.

00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:31.271 align:middle line:84%
We are looking at coefficients.

00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.873 align:middle line:84%
The third coefficient here is 15.

00:03:33.873 --> 00:03:37.207 align:middle line:90%
You can view this fourth
term, or this fourth number,

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:40.903 align:middle line:90%
as the coefficient because
this could be rewritten as,

00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:42.004 align:middle line:84%
instead of just writing as nine,

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:45.885 align:middle line:90%
you could write it as
nine x to the zero power.

00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:48.404 align:middle line:90%
And then it looks a little bit
clearer, like a coefficient.

00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:51.901 align:middle line:84%
So, in general, a polynomial is the sum

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:56.581 align:middle line:90%
of a finite number of
terms where each term

00:03:56.581 --> 00:03:59.226 align:middle line:84%
has a coefficient, which I could represent

00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:03.297 align:middle line:90%
with the letter A, being
multiplied by a variable

00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:09.999 align:middle line:90%
being raised to a
nonnegative integer power.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.654 align:middle line:84%
So, this right over here is a coefficient.

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:15.812 align:middle line:84%
It can be, if we're dealing...

00:04:15.812 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't wanna get too technical.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Positive, negative number.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.855 align:middle line:84%
Could be any real number.

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:22.239 align:middle line:84%
We have our variable.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:28.014 align:middle line:90%
And then the exponent,
here, has to be nonnegative.

00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:30.516 align:middle line:84%
Nonnegative

00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:32.603 align:middle line:84%
integer.

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:34.475 align:middle line:90%
So here, the reason
why what I wrote in red

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:36.595 align:middle line:84%
is not a polynomial is because here I have

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
an exponent that is a negative integer.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.355 align:middle line:84%
Let's give some other examples

00:04:41.355 --> 00:04:44.201 align:middle line:84%
of things that are not polynomials.

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:49.041 align:middle line:84%
So, if I were to change the second one to,

00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:50.301 align:middle line:84%
instead of nine a squared,

00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:54.815 align:middle line:90%
if I wrote it as nine a to
the one half power minus five,

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:57.335 align:middle line:90%
this is not a polynomial
because this exponent

00:04:57.335 --> 00:05:00.668 align:middle line:90%
right over here, it is
no longer an integer;

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
it's one half.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.137 align:middle line:84%
This is the same thing as nine times

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:07.739 align:middle line:84%
the square root of a minus five.

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:11.885 align:middle line:84%
This also would not be a polynomial.

00:05:11.885 --> 00:05:18.553 align:middle line:90%
Or, if I were to write nine
a to the a power minus five,

00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:21.315 align:middle line:90%
also not a polynomial
because here the exponent

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:26.642 align:middle line:90%
is a variable; it's not
a nonnegative integer.

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:31.036 align:middle line:84%
All of these are examples of polynomials.

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:33.879 align:middle line:84%
There's a few more pieces of terminology

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.036 align:middle line:84%
that are valuable to know.

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:41.483 align:middle line:90%
Polynomial is a general term
for one of these expression

00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:44.525 align:middle line:84%
that has multiple terms, a finite number,

00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:46.108 align:middle line:84%
so not an infinite number,

00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:48.751 align:middle line:84%
and each of the terms has this form.

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.334 align:middle line:84%
But there's more specific terms for when

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:54.929 align:middle line:90%
you have only one term or
two terms or three terms.

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.659 align:middle line:90%
When you have one term,
it's called a monomial.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.592 align:middle line:84%
This is a monomial.

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:04.177 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of a monomial,

00:06:04.177 --> 00:06:06.874 align:middle line:84%
which we could write as six x to the zero.

00:06:06.874 --> 00:06:10.776 align:middle line:84%
Another example of a monomial might be

00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:14.754 align:middle line:84%
10z to the 15th power.

00:06:14.754 --> 00:06:16.339 align:middle line:84%
That's also a monomial.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Your coefficient could be pi.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.533 align:middle line:84%
Pi.

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:20.529 align:middle line:84%
Whoops.

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:21.812 align:middle line:84%
Could be pi.

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:28.271 align:middle line:90%
So we could write pi times
b to the fifth power.

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:30.921 align:middle line:84%
Any of these would be monomials.

00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.424 align:middle line:84%
So what's a binomial?

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:33.849 align:middle line:84%
Binomial's where you have two terms.

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.129 align:middle line:84%
Monomial, mono for one, one term.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.161 align:middle line:84%
Binomial is you have two terms.

00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:41.167 align:middle line:84%
This right over here is a binomial.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.345 align:middle line:84%
Binomial.

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:44.132 align:middle line:84%
You have two terms.

00:06:44.132 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:90%
All these are polynomials but
these are subclassifications.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.339 align:middle line:84%
It's a binomial; you have one, two terms.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:55.069 align:middle line:84%
Another example of a binomial would be

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.797 align:middle line:84%
three y to the third plus five y.

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:00.625 align:middle line:84%
Once again, you have two terms

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:03.358 align:middle line:84%
that have this form right over here.

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:05.889 align:middle line:84%
You'll also hear the term trinomial.

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.408 align:middle line:84%
Trinomial's when you have three terms.

00:07:08.408 --> 00:07:11.499 align:middle line:84%
Trinomial.

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:12.999 align:middle line:84%
This right over here is an example.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the first term;

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.006 align:middle line:84%
this is the second term;

00:07:16.006 --> 00:07:19.223 align:middle line:84%
and this is the third term.

00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:22.616 align:middle line:90%
Now, the next word that
you will hear often

00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:26.192 align:middle line:90%
in the context with
polynomials is the notion

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:29.486 align:middle line:84%
of the degree of a polynomial.

00:07:29.486 --> 00:07:30.993 align:middle line:84%
You might hear people say:

00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:84%
"What is the degree of a polynomial?",

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.396 align:middle line:90%
or "What is the degree of a
given term of a polynomial?"

00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:39.924 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the
degree of a given term.

00:07:39.924 --> 00:07:41.299 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to this polynomial here.

00:07:41.299 --> 00:07:44.024 align:middle line:90%
We have this first term,
10x to the seventh.

00:07:44.024 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
The degree is the power that
we're raising the variable to.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.669 align:middle line:84%
So this is a seventh-degree term.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.393 align:middle line:84%
The second term is a second-degree term.

00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:55.648 align:middle line:84%
The third term is a third-degree term.

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:57.273 align:middle line:84%
And you could view this constant term,

00:07:57.273 --> 00:07:59.752 align:middle line:90%
which is really just nine,
you could view that as,

00:07:59.752 --> 00:08:01.583 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people say the constant term.

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:05.282 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes people will
say the zero-degree term.

00:08:05.282 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
If people are talking about the degree

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.203 align:middle line:90%
of the entire polynomial,
they're gonna say:

00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:11.842 align:middle line:84%
"What is the degree of the highest term?

00:08:11.842 --> 00:08:14.164 align:middle line:90%
"What is the term with
the highest degree?"

00:08:14.164 --> 00:08:17.418 align:middle line:90%
That degree will be the degree
of the entire polynomial.

00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:19.244 align:middle line:84%
So, this first polynomial,

00:08:19.244 --> 00:08:22.047 align:middle line:84%
this is a seventh-degree polynomial.

00:08:22.047 --> 00:08:25.859 align:middle line:90%
This one right over here is
a second-degree polynomial

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:27.315 align:middle line:84%
because it has a second-degree term

00:08:27.315 --> 00:08:29.753 align:middle line:84%
and that's the highest-degree term.

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
This right over here is a third-degree.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.952 align:middle line:84%
You could even say third-degree binomial

00:08:34.952 --> 00:08:38.287 align:middle line:90%
because its highest-degree
term has degree three.

00:08:38.287 --> 00:08:41.248 align:middle line:90%
If this said five y to the
seventh instead of five y,

00:08:41.248 --> 00:08:44.095 align:middle line:90%
then it would be a
seventh-degree binomial.

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:47.916 align:middle line:90%
This right over here is
a 15th-degree monomial.

00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:56.519 align:middle line:84%
This is a second-degree trinomial.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:58.548 align:middle line:84%
A few more things I will introduce you to

00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:02.121 align:middle line:90%
is the idea of a leading term
and a leading coefficient.

00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:03.178 align:middle line:84%
Lemme write this down.

00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:10.173 align:middle line:84%
The notion of what it means to be leading.

00:09:10.173 --> 00:09:14.322 align:middle line:90%
It can mean whatever is the
first term or the coefficient.

00:09:14.322 --> 00:09:16.836 align:middle line:90%
If you're saying leading
term, it's the first term.

00:09:16.836 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
If you're saying leading coefficient,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.191 align:middle line:84%
it's the coefficient in the first term.

00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:22.428 align:middle line:84%
But it's oftentimes associated with

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:26.788 align:middle line:90%
a polynomial being
written in standard form.

00:09:26.788 --> 00:09:29.933 align:middle line:84%
Standard form.

00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:32.942 align:middle line:84%
Standard form

00:09:32.942 --> 00:09:35.997 align:middle line:90%
is where you write the
terms in degree order,

00:09:35.997 --> 00:09:39.003 align:middle line:84%
starting with the highest-degree term.

00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:41.362 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, what I have up here,

00:09:41.362 --> 00:09:43.562 align:middle line:84%
this is not in standard form;

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:90%
because I do have the
highest-degree term first,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.382 align:middle line:84%
but then I should go to the next highest,

00:09:47.382 --> 00:09:48.884 align:middle line:84%
which is the x to the third.

00:09:48.884 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:90%
But here I wrote x squared
next, so this is not standard.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.195 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to write it in standard form,

00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:55.717 align:middle line:84%
it would be 10x to the seventh power,

00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:58.887 align:middle line:90%
which is the highest-degree
term, has degree seven.

00:09:58.887 --> 00:10:01.039 align:middle line:84%
Then, 15x to the third.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:04.858 align:middle line:90%
So, plus 15x to the third, which
is the next highest degree.

00:10:04.858 --> 00:10:08.108 align:middle line:84%
Then, negative nine x squared

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.897 align:middle line:84%
is the next highest degree term.

00:10:09.897 --> 00:10:12.342 align:middle line:90%
And then, the lowest-degree
term here is plus nine,

00:10:12.342 --> 00:10:14.456 align:middle line:84%
or plus nine x to zero.

00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:16.367 align:middle line:84%
Now this is in standard form.

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:19.131 align:middle line:90%
I have written the terms in
order of decreasing degree,

00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:21.045 align:middle line:84%
with the highest degree first.

00:10:21.045 --> 00:10:25.112 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's clear that your leading term

00:10:25.112 --> 00:10:29.265 align:middle line:90%
is 10x to the seventh,
'cause it's the first one,

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:34.377 align:middle line:90%
and our leading coefficient
here is the number 10.

00:10:34.377 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So, there was a lot in that video,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.205 align:middle line:84%
but hopefully the notion of a polynomial

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.966 align:middle line:90%
isn't seeming too
intimidating at this point.

00:10:40.966 --> 00:10:43.446 align:middle line:90%
These are really useful
words to be familiar with

00:10:43.446 --> 00:10:48.446 align:middle line:84%
as you continue on on your math journey.
