1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:05,686
- [Sal] Let's explore the
notion of a polynomial.

2
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:07,677
This seems like a very complicated word,

3
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:09,463
but if you break it down
it'll start to make sense,

4
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:13,285
especially when we start to
see examples of polynomials.

5
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,440
The first part of this word,

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,791
lemme underline it, we have poly.

7
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,621
This comes from Greek, for many.

8
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,912
You see poly a lot in
the English language,

9
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:26,432
referring to the notion
of many of something.

10
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:29,282
In this case, it's many nomials.

11
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:33,631
Nomial comes from Latin, from
the Latin nomen, for name.

12
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,271
You could view this as many names.

13
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,897
But in a mathematical context,

14
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:40,298
it's really referring to many terms.

15
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:41,882
We're gonna talk, in a little bit,

16
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,239
about what a term really is.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,207
But to get a tangible sense
of what are polynomials

18
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:50,378
and what are not polynomials,
lemme give you some examples.

19
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:51,959
And then we could write some, maybe,

20
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,313
more formal rules for them.

21
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:57,771
So, an example of a polynomial could be

22
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:01,771
10x to the seventh power
minus nine x squared

23
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,529
plus 15x to the third plus nine.

24
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,491
This is a polynomial.

25
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,686
Another example of a polynomial.

26
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,853
Nine a squared minus five.

27
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:18,549
Even if I just have one number,

28
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:21,843
even if I were to just
write the number six,

29
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:24,973
that can officially be
considered a polynomial.

30
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:29,140
If I were to write seven
x squared minus three.

31
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:31,118
Lemme do it another variable.

32
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,285
Seven y squared minus three y plus pi,

33
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,810
that, too, would be a polynomial.

34
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,356
These are examples of polynomials.

35
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:43,890
What are examples of things
that are not polynomials?

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,078
Well, if I were to
replace the seventh power

37
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,151
right over here with a
negative seven power.

38
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,964
If I were to write 10x to
the negative seven power

39
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:58,131
minus nine x squared plus 15x
to the third power plus nine,

40
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,417
this would not be a polynomial.

41
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,249
So I think you might
be sensing a rule here

42
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,133
for what makes something a polynomial.

43
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:09,201
You have to have nonnegative powers

44
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:12,250
of your variable in each of the terms.

45
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,524
I just used that word,
terms, so lemme explain it,

46
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:17,246
'cause it'll help me explain
what a polynomial is.

47
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:22,079
A polynomial is something that
is made up of a sum of terms.

48
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,332
And so, for example, in
this first polynomial,

49
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:27,930
the first term is 10x to the seventh;

50
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:31,344
the second term is
negative nine x squared;

51
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:33,781
the next term is 15x to the third;

52
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:34,880
and then the last term,

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,561
maybe you could say the
fourth term, is nine.

54
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,691
You can see something.

55
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,918
Let me underline these.

56
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,623
These are all terms.

57
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:46,810
This is a four-term
polynomial right over here.

58
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,637
You could say: "Hey, wait,
this thing you wrote in red,

59
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,304
"this also has four terms."

60
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,130
We have to put a few more rules for it

61
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,350
to officially be a polynomial,

62
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,873
especially a polynomial in one variable.

63
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:57,296
Each of those terms are going

64
00:02:57,296 --> 00:03:00,102
to be made up of a coefficient.

65
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,973
This is the thing that multiplies

66
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,492
the variable to some power.

67
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:07,641
So in this first term
the coefficient is 10.

68
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:10,606
Lemme write this word down, coefficient.

69
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:13,000
It's another fancy word,
but it's just a thing

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,706
that's multiplied, in this case,

71
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:17,518
times the variable, which
is x to seventh power.

72
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,488
The first coefficient is 10.

73
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,708
The next coefficient.

74
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,543
Actually, lemme be careful here,

75
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:26,710
because the second coefficient
here is negative nine.

76
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,236
We are looking at coefficients.

77
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,873
The third coefficient here is 15.

78
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:37,207
You can view this fourth
term, or this fourth number,

79
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,903
as the coefficient because
this could be rewritten as,

80
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:42,004
instead of just writing as nine,

81
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:45,885
you could write it as
nine x to the zero power.

82
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:48,404
And then it looks a little bit
clearer, like a coefficient.

83
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:51,901
So, in general, a polynomial is the sum

84
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:55,484
of a finite number of
terms where each term

85
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:59,226
has a coefficient, which I could represent

86
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:03,297
with the letter A, being
multiplied by a variable

87
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:06,964
being raised to a
nonnegative integer power.

88
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,654
So, this right over here is a coefficient.

89
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,811
It can be, if we're dealing...

90
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:17,360
Well, I don't wanna get too technical.

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,730
Positive, negative number.

92
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,855
Could be any real number.

93
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:22,239
We have our variable.

94
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:26,405
And then the exponent,
here, has to be nonnegative.

95
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:28,931
Nonnegative

96
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:31,349
integer.

97
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:34,475
So here, the reason
why what I wrote in red

98
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,595
is not a polynomial is because here I have

99
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,930
an exponent that is a negative integer.

100
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,355
Let's give some other examples

101
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:44,201
of things that are not polynomials.

102
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,701
So, if I were to change the second one to,

103
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,301
instead of nine a squared,

104
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:54,815
if I wrote it as nine a to
the one half power minus five,

105
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:57,335
this is not a polynomial
because this exponent

106
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:00,668
right over here, it is
no longer an integer;

107
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,250
it's one half.

108
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,137
This is the same thing as nine times

109
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:07,739
the square root of a minus five.

110
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,739
This also would not be a polynomial.

111
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:16,051
Or, if I were to write nine
a to the a power minus five,

112
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:21,315
also not a polynomial
because here the exponent

113
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:25,148
is a variable; it's not
a nonnegative integer.

114
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:30,058
All of these are examples of polynomials.

115
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:33,879
There's a few more pieces of terminology

116
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,046
that are valuable to know.

117
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:41,483
Polynomial is a general term
for one of these expression

118
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:44,525
that has multiple terms, a finite number,

119
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:46,108
so not an infinite number,

120
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,751
and each of the terms has this form.

121
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,334
But there's more specific terms for when

122
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:54,929
you have only one term or
two terms or three terms.

123
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:58,659
When you have one term,
it's called a monomial.

124
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,242
This is a monomial.

125
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,176
This is an example of a monomial,

126
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,874
which we could write as six x to the zero.

127
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:10,776
Another example of a monomial might be

128
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:12,609
10z to the 15th power.

129
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,339
That's also a monomial.

130
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,700
Your coefficient could be pi.

131
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,533
Pi.

132
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,529
Whoops.

133
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:21,812
Could be pi.

134
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:25,812
So we could write pi times
b to the fifth power.

135
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,921
Any of these would be monomials.

136
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,424
So what's a binomial?

137
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:33,849
Binomial's where you have two terms.

138
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,128
Monomial, mono for one, one term.

139
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,161
Binomial is you have two terms.

140
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:41,167
This right over here is a binomial.

141
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,344
Binomial.

142
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:44,132
You have two terms.

143
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:47,590
All these are polynomials but
these are subclassifications.

144
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,339
It's a binomial; you have one, two terms.

145
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,506
Another example of a binomial would be

146
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:57,819
three y to the third plus five y.

147
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,625
Once again, you have two terms

148
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,358
that have this form right over here.

149
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:05,889
You'll also hear the term trinomial.

150
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,408
Trinomial's when you have three terms.

151
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:09,241
Trinomial.

152
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,999
This right over here is an example.

153
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,340
This is the first term;

154
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,006
this is the second term;

155
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:18,256
and this is the third term.

156
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:22,616
Now, the next word that
you will hear often

157
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:26,192
in the context with
polynomials is the notion

158
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:29,486
of the degree of a polynomial.

159
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:30,993
You might hear people say:

160
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,590
"What is the degree of a polynomial?",

161
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,395
or "What is the degree of a
given term of a polynomial?"

162
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,924
Let's start with the
degree of a given term.

163
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,299
Let's go to this polynomial here.

164
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:44,024
We have this first term,
10x to the seventh.

165
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:47,390
The degree is the power that
we're raising the variable to.

166
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,669
So this is a seventh-degree term.

167
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,393
The second term is a second-degree term.

168
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:55,647
The third term is a third-degree term.

169
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,273
And you could view this constant term,

170
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:59,752
which is really just nine,
you could view that as,

171
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:01,583
sometimes people say the constant term.

172
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:05,282
Sometimes people will
say the zero-degree term.

173
00:08:05,282 --> 00:08:07,010
If people are talking about the degree

174
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,203
of the entire polynomial,
they're gonna say:

175
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:11,842
"What is the degree of the highest term?

176
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:14,164
"What is the term with
the highest degree?"

177
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:17,418
That degree will be the degree
of the entire polynomial.

178
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:19,244
So, this first polynomial,

179
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:22,047
this is a seventh-degree polynomial.

180
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:25,859
This one right over here is
a second-degree polynomial

181
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,315
because it has a second-degree term

182
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,753
and that's the highest-degree term.

183
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,390
This right over here is a third-degree.

184
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,952
You could even say third-degree binomial

185
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:38,287
because its highest-degree
term has degree three.

186
00:08:38,287 --> 00:08:41,248
If this said five y to the
seventh instead of five y,

187
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:44,095
then it would be a
seventh-degree binomial.

188
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:47,916
This right over here is
a 15th-degree monomial.

189
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,749
This is a second-degree trinomial.

190
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,548
A few more things I will introduce you to

191
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:02,121
is the idea of a leading term
and a leading coefficient.

192
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,178
Lemme write this down.

193
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:06,678
The notion of what it means to be leading.

194
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:14,322
It can mean whatever is the
first term or the coefficient.

195
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,836
If you're saying leading
term, it's the first term.

196
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,140
If you're saying leading coefficient,

197
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,191
it's the coefficient in the first term.

198
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:22,428
But it's oftentimes associated with

199
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,788
a polynomial being
written in standard form.

200
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:27,955
Standard form.

201
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,016
Standard form

202
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:35,997
is where you write the
terms in degree order,

203
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:39,002
starting with the highest-degree term.

204
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:41,362
So, for example, what I have up here,

205
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,562
this is not in standard form;

206
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:45,960
because I do have the
highest-degree term first,

207
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,382
but then I should go to the next highest,

208
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:48,883
which is the x to the third.

209
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:51,160
But here I wrote x squared
next, so this is not standard.

210
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,194
If I wanted to write it in standard form,

211
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,717
it would be 10x to the seventh power,

212
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:58,887
which is the highest-degree
term, has degree seven.

213
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,039
Then, 15x to the third.

214
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,858
So, plus 15x to the third, which
is the next highest degree.

215
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:08,108
Then, negative nine x squared

216
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,896
is the next highest degree term.

217
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:12,342
And then, the lowest-degree
term here is plus nine,

218
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,456
or plus nine x to zero.

219
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,367
Now this is in standard form.

220
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,131
I have written the terms in
order of decreasing degree,

221
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:21,045
with the highest degree first.

222
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:25,112
Here, it's clear that your leading term

223
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:29,265
is 10x to the seventh,
'cause it's the first one,

224
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:33,432
and our leading coefficient
here is the number 10.

225
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,170
So, there was a lot in that video,

226
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,204
but hopefully the notion of a polynomial

227
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,966
isn't seeming too
intimidating at this point.

228
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,446
These are really useful
words to be familiar with

229
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:46,779
as you continue on on your math journey.
