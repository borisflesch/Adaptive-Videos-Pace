1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,430
In the following polynomial,
identify the terms along

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,640
with the coefficient and
exponent of each term.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,590
So the terms are just
the things being added up

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,469
in this polynomial.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,180
So the terms here-- let
me write the terms here.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,759
The first term is 3x squared.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,290
The second term it's being
added to negative 8x.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,490
You might say, hey
wait, isn't it minus 8x?

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,988
And you could just
view that as it's

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,470
being added to negative 8x.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,940
So negative 8x is
the second term.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,410
And then the third
term here is 7.

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,050
It's called a polynomial.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,459
Poly, it has many terms.

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,610
Or you could view each
term as a monomial,

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,390
as a polynomial with
only one term in it.

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,007
So those are the terms.

18
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,589
Now let's think about
the coefficients

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,830
of each of the terms.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,720
The coefficient is what's
multiplying the power of x

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,960
or what's multiplying in
the x part of the term.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,900
So over here, the x
part is x squared.

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,815
That's being multiplied by 3.

24
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:05,179
So 3 is the coefficient
on the first term.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,460
On the second term, we have
negative 8 multiplying x.

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,710
And we want to be clear, the
coefficient isn't just 8.

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,490
It's a negative 8.

28
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,600
It's negative 8
that's multiplying x.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,699
So that's the coefficient
right over here.

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,270
And here you might
say, hey wait,

31
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,580
nothing is multiplying x here.

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,429
I just have a 7.

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,540
There is no x.

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,460
7 isn't being multiplied by x.

35
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,559
But you can think of this as 7
being multiplied by x to the 0

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,310
because we know that x to the
zeroth power is equal to 1.

37
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,890
So we would even call
this constant, the 7,

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,490
this would be the
coefficient on 7x to the 0.

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,660
So you could view
this as a coefficient.

40
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,104
So this is also a coefficient.

41
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:53,393
So let me make it clear, these
three things are coefficients.

42
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,030
Now the last part, they
want us to identify

43
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,420
the exponent of each term.

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,180
So the exponent of
this first term is 2.

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,120
It's being raised
to the second power.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,160
The exponent of the second
term, remember, negative 8x, x

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,810
is the same thing as
x to the first power.

48
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,920
So the exponent here is 1.

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,519
And then on this last
term, we already said,

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,230
7 is the same thing
as 7x to the 0.

51
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,560
So the exponent here on the
constant term on 7 is 0.

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,780
So these things right over
here, those are our exponents.

53
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,190
And we are done.
