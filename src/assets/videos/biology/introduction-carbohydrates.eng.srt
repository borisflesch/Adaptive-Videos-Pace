00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,890
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,439
is give ourselves a quick
introduction to carbohydrates,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,367
and you might already be
familiar with the notion.

4
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:10,910
If you look at some packaged food,

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,208
there's usually a nutritional label

6
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,730
and will say carbohydrates.

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,030
It will tell you a certain
number of grams per serving.

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,900
And not all carbohydrates are edible,

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,580
but many of the things that we eat

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,580
or many carbohydrates are edible

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,470
and many of the foods we eat

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,360
have some carbohydrate component to it.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,550
But what is it actually?

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,170
Well, we can look at the
word and we see carbo,

15
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,030
so maybe it has something
to do with carbons.

16
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,250
And it says hydrates,

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,470
so maybe it has something
to do with water.

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,960
And if you said that,
you'd be pretty close

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,590
because carbohydrates do involve carbons.

20
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,710
In fact, this is a very
typical carbohydrate,

21
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,310
a very simple one right over here.

22
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,350
This is a glucose molecule.

23
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,540
And in gray, you see
that it has six carbons.

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,800
And the hydrate part refers to,

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,349
that carbohydrates typically
have oxygen to hydrogens

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,940
in the same ratio as you
would expect in water.

27
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,379
So, for every one oxygen, two hydrogens,

28
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,959
and you see that right over here,

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,649
where in glucose, you have one, two,

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,450
three, four, five, six oxygens

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,870
and you have 12 hydrogens,

32
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,320
and so that's where this word comes from.

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,669
Now, another word that is often used

34
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,142
interchangeably with carbohydrates
is the term saccharide.

35
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:25,780
Saccharide, and saccharide
comes from Greek for sweet,

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,650
and that makes sense because
if you were to taste glucose,

37
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,290
it would taste sweet to you.

38
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,920
Now, what's interesting
about something like glucose

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,970
is glucose can be a standalone molecule,

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,730
a very simple sugar in this case

41
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,630
or you can build up larger molecules

42
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,229
with really glucose as a building block.

43
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,340
So for example, right over here,

44
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,260
we have a part of a glycogen molecule.

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,093
And as you can see,

46
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,600
it's just a repeating
sequence of glucose molecules.

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,320
And so, something like this,

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,300
we would call glucose a monosaccharide.

49
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,440
It's one simple sugar right over here.

50
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,399
Monosaccharide.

51
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,800
And we would call this
glycogen a polysaccharide.

52
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,160
Polysaccharide.

53
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,620
Or another way to think about it

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,560
is glucose is the building
block for the glycogen.

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,070
Another term you might see
is monomer and polymer.

56
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,329
Those are the general terms

57
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,250
or if I'm building a large molecule

58
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,380
out of a chain of smaller ones,

59
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,370
the building blocks, we
consider to be monomers,

60
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,220
and then the thing that we
build out of those monomers

61
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,520
could be our polymer.

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,680
And as we'll see, this
monomer polymer phenomenon

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,830
is not limited to
carbohydrates or saccharides.

64
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,080
We're gonna see that same
relationship, for example,

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,410
between amino acids and proteins.

66
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,010
Now, what role do carbohydrates play

67
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,130
inside of biological systems?

68
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,359
Well, saccharides or carbohydrates

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,330
are often associated
with the source energy.

70
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,060
Glucose can be converted

71
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,970
very quickly to energy
in biological cells.

72
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,720
Glycogen is also a store of energy

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,320
in your liver and your muscles.

74
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,299
And once again, it can be broken down

75
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,216
into the glucose molecules,
which once again,

76
00:03:16,216 --> 00:03:20,520
is a very readily
available source of energy.

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,610
Now, in plants especially,
some of these polysaccharides

78
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,530
could also play a structural role

79
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,220
if we're talking about
things like cellulose,

80
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,609
which is another polysaccharide.

81
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,560
So, there's also a structural role.

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,850
Now, I will leave you there.

83
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,420
We have focused only on one type

84
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,220
of monosaccharide in glucose,

85
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,530
and only on one type of
polysaccharide in glycogen.

86
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,010
As we will see, glucose does show up a lot

87
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,030
but there are many other
types of monosaccharides

88
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,340
and there are many other
types of polysaccharides.

89
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,870
And polysaccharides in particular are part

90
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,000
of a broader group of molecules
known as macromolecules.

91
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,030
And as you can imagine,
from the macro prefix,

92
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,120
it's referring to large molecules,

93
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,320
oftentimes that have
thousands of atoms in them.

94
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
But don't get the wrong idea.

95
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,609
They're very large at an atomic level

96
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,980
but each of these circles are still atoms,

97
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,159
so you would still need a very, very,

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,190
very, very powerful microscope
to even to take a look

99
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,990
at even some of the
largest macromolecules,

100
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,420
including polysaccharides.
