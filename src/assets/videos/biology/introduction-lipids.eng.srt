00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,310
- [Instructor] What we are
going to do in this video

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,320
is talk a little bit about lipids.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,610
Now, a lot of times,

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,800
lipids are strongly associated with fats,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,730
and that's not incorrect.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,230
Fats are lipids,

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,680
but not all lipids are fats.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,140
A better definition or
a better association

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,700
for lipids would be a class of molecules

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,259
that you often see in biological
systems that are not so

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,180
water

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,190
soluble.

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,270
And I didn't say outright hydrophobic,

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,890
which means not attracted to water,

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,490
because there are definitely lipids

16
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,240
that have parts that are hydrophobic,

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,690
that are trying to get
away from the water.

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,849
But there is other parts
that are hydrophilic,

19
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,850
that like the water,

20
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,800
that would be attracted
to water molecules.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,099
Now, in terms of roles
they play in the body,

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,210
and we can think of fat molecules here,

23
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,380
well, they definitely play a role

24
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,590
in terms of energy

25
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,540
storage.

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,629
Whenever I look at my belly,

27
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,830
I just like to think of all that energy

28
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,670
that is there covering my six-pack.

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,580
They could be involved in signaling.

30
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,250
In future videos, we're
going to study hormones,

31
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,390
and hormones are nothing but molecules

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,820
that help transmit a signal
from one part of the body

33
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,669
to another part of the body.

34
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,400
And many of these hormones are lipids.

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,440
They're also involved in membranes.

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,470
So a lot of the time in biology,

37
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,840
we're gonna talk about cellular membranes

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,850
and how they're formed
with these phospholipids.

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,119
And we'll see these
phospholipids, in particular,

40
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,630
have one end that's trying
to get away from the water

41
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,020
and another end that is
attracted to the water.

42
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,140
And that's actually what
makes them good for membranes.

43
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,040
Just going back to fats,
let's actually take a look

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040
at what some of these
lipid molecules look like.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,010
So this right over here is
an example of a fat molecule,

46
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,000
but the general structure
you're going to have is

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,340
these three fatty acids.

48
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,750
So that's one right over there,

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,330
one fatty acid,

50
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,960
two fatty acids,

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,540
and three fatty acids

52
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,489
that are connected to a glycerol.

53
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,360
And don't worry too much
about the words here.

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,860
You'll study them more when you get

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,660
to an organic chemistry class.

56
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,359
But that's where this word
triglyceride comes from,

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,410
tri- for your three fatty acids

58
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,950
and -glyceride from a glycerol.

59
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,950
And triglyceride is, in
fact, another word for fat.

60
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,180
And what makes a triglyceride
not so soluble in water?

61
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,410
Look at these long hydrocarbon
chains where you just

62
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,940
essentially have a bunch
of carbons and hydrogens.

63
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,570
Those parts, remember, things
that are soluble in water,

64
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,310
they tend to be polar molecules,

65
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,360
things that have a partial
charge on one end or another

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,780
or even a full charge.

67
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,090
But when we look at
these hydrocarbon chains,

68
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,660
they tend to not have
these partial charges on

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,770
one side or another,

70
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,120
and so that doesn't make
them so soluble in water.

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,420
And another word that you sometimes hear

72
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,030
associated with fats,
saturated or unsaturated fat.

73
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,700
That's really referring to what's going on

74
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,470
on these hydrocarbon chains.

75
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,900
If the carbons are as bonded

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,970
to as many hydrogens as they can,

77
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,810
well, then you're talking
about a saturated fat.

78
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,700
It's saturated with hydrogens.

79
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,000
If it's not bounded, if it,
in theory, it could bond

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,120
to more hydrogens because it
has some double bonds in there,

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,640
well, then it's unsaturated.

82
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,260
Maybe in a future video, we'll
talk about the health issues

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,980
of saturated versus unsaturated fat.

84
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,760
Sometimes in popular
culture, fat gets a bad name

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,450
because everyone's trying
to get their six-packs

86
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,859
or whatever else, but it's
very important to realize that

87
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,100
without fats you would die.

88
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,989
Many vitamins, which are
not so soluble in water,

89
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,170
making them, in fact, lipids,

90
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,809
need fat in order to be
absorbed into the body properly.

91
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,239
But as I also mentioned,
all lipids are not fats.

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,820
Here are more examples of lipids,

93
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,150
and I'm not gonna go into detail

94
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,980
into their molecular structure.

95
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,119
But you see something similar here.

96
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,500
They all have long chains of hydrocarbons

97
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,209
that aren't so soluble in water.

98
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,909
These parts right over
here would be hydrophobic,

99
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,680
hydrophobic.

100
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,680
But what's interesting, especially
about this sphingomyelin,

101
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,150
which is involved in your
myelin sheath in the brain,

102
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,669
it helps electrically insulate neurons,

103
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,160
it's also involved in membranes,

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,040
it makes up a substantial part

105
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,850
of the phospholipids in membranes,

106
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,320
is that this sphingomyelin right over here

107
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,230
has a part that actually is hydrophilic.

108
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,810
And as we'll see later on,

109
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,717
that's what makes things,
molecules like this,

110
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:48,530
phospholipids, this is
a sphingophospholipid,

111
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,770
makes them good for membrane structures.

112
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,229
Because the part that's
attracted to the water

113
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,490
could be on the outside,

114
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,740
and the part that's not
attracted to the water

115
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,010
could be on the inside.

116
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,210
And so you can form these membranes

117
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,039
that a cross-section of which
would look something like this

118
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,950
where the circular parts
are the part that want,

119
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,570
the parts that want to
be around the water,

120
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,849
while these tails right over here,

121
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,630
these are the hydrophobic chains

122
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,360
that want to go away from the water.

123
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,320
And this is, in fact,

124
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,610
what cellular membranes actually look like

125
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,670
if you were zoom really,
really, really far in.

126
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,090
I'll leave you there.

127
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,729
Between lipids, carbohydrates,
proteins, nucleic acids,

128
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,870
we've really covered
the major macromolecules

129
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,140
that you will see in biological systems.

130
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,229
Once again, what makes
them macromolecules?

131
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,610
Well, they can be composed

132
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,510
of many, many, many, many, many atoms.

133
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,870
They aren't small molecules.
