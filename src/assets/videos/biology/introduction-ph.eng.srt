00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:01,112
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

2
00:00:01,112 --> 00:00:02,961
is talk about acidity and in particular,

3
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:06,186
we're gonna talk about the pH scale.

4
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:09,552
Now the first question
is what does pH stand for

5
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,613
and it turns out that there's some debate

6
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:14,285
why we have this lowercase p here,

7
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,094
we know why we have the h,

8
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:17,787
and some people will tell you it stands

9
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:22,717
for power of hydrogen, the
capital h for hydrogen.

10
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:26,884
Some people will say it's
the potential of hydrogen.

11
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:32,034
Some people will say it's
the capacity for hydrogen,

12
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:35,803
you might say capacity
doesn't start with a p

13
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,983
but if you go into Latin, it can.

14
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,915
But what do all of these things mean

15
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,137
and why do we care about hydrogen so much?

16
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:45,400
Well, it turns out that
hydrogen, and in particular,

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,034
a hydrogen positive ion, and ion

18
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:50,655
is just a positively charged molecule,

19
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:53,061
that a hydrogen ion can play a major role

20
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,917
in how acidic or basic something is.

21
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:58,192
And so the pH scale, you're gonna see it

22
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,692
go from zero all the way to 14

23
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,938
with of course, seven in the middle,

24
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:09,617
and something that is towards the left,

25
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:13,460
something that is less than
seven is considered acidic,

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,041
and so if you have a pH near zero

27
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,337
that is highly, highly, highly acidic,

28
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:21,494
while something to the
right is considered basic

29
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:25,961
and something in the middle
is considered neutral.

30
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,178
And another term for
basic you'll sometimes see

31
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:31,946
is alkaline, and alkaline
actually comes from Arabic

32
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:35,777
for alkali which was the word
that ancient Arab chemists use

33
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:39,933
for a compound that
happens to be very basic

34
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,116
by our modern definition.

35
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:44,299
But what does it mean to be acidic

36
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,945
and what does it mean to be basic

37
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:49,520
and once again, how does that
connect with hydrogen ions?

38
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,209
Well, it turns out, and
I'm not gonna go in depth

39
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,264
in this video, is that
things that are acidic

40
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:57,097
tend to have lots of hydrogen ions

41
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:03,136
and while things that
are basic tend to react,

42
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,436
react with these hydrogen ions.

43
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,886
There's other definitions
for what it means

44
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:10,720
to be an acid or base
and we'll go into depth

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,233
in chemistry class on that,

46
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,000
but this is why it's
connected with the term pH.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,905
Now what are examples of
things that are acidic?

48
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,856
Well, you see it on this
chart right over here.

49
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,616
Here, we're going in
the vertical direction.

50
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,194
Things in our everyday
life that are quite acidic,

51
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:28,248
a lot of fruits are quite acidic,

52
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,218
for example, lemons and grapefruits

53
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:33,185
and orange juice are quite acidic.

54
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,920
They're at the low end of the scale.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,046
And some of the telltale signs for acidity

56
00:02:37,046 --> 00:02:39,696
is if you were to drink it or eat it,

57
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:43,475
that it would have this kind
of sharp sour taste to it,

58
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:46,400
while if you go to the
other end of the spectrum,

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,846
things that are basic, these
would be things like bleaches

60
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:52,170
and ammonia solution and we can even go

61
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,137
super basic to liquid drain cleaner,

62
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:59,210
and these are going to have
more of a slimy texture to it.

63
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,282
In fact, even soap is quite basic.

64
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,498
And of the basic things
that you could eat,

65
00:03:03,498 --> 00:03:07,755
you might have a bitter
taste associated with it.

66
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:09,941
But to be clear, I really don't recommend

67
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,494
eating or drinking anything
that is either highly basic

68
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,940
or highly acidic, and the reason is

69
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,143
is that things that are at
the extreme of the pH scale,

70
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:22,233
so things that are either extremely basic

71
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,150
or things that are extremely acidic

72
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:29,321
like battery acid or hydrochloric acid,

73
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,807
because they're so reactive,
they will damage you.

74
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,940
If you pour it in your
skin, it will damage you.

75
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,200
If you ingest it, it
will damage your cells

76
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,917
and it can even kill you.

77
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,507
So don't try to taste things to see

78
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,517
whether they're acid or
basic, and if you do,

79
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,012
try to make sure that they're closer

80
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:49,095
to this middle range of our pH scale.

81
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,259
So I've talked a lot about
things that are acidic

82
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,587
or basic, but also what's interesting

83
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:57,215
is things that we consider to be neutral.

84
00:03:57,216 --> 00:04:00,386
So our blood, for
example, is quite neutral,

85
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,763
and this is something
that doctors might measure

86
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:05,750
because if your pH in your
blood gets a little bit too high

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,583
or a little bit too low,

88
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,704
that can cause some serious problems.

89
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:11,735
Sea water is pretty
close to being neutral.

90
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:15,006
Milk is not that far off of being neutral.

91
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,064
Now with that said, in order to read

92
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:20,004
the pH scale appropriately
or appreciate the differences

93
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,011
in acidity and basicity,
it's important to realize

94
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:25,255
that it is not a linear scale.

95
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:28,851
So for example, something
that has a pH of eight

96
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:33,319
is not twice as basic as
something that has a pH of four.

97
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,290
It turns out, when you go
form one level of our pH scale

98
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,265
to the other, you are
going up in basicity,

99
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:42,098
say going from a pH four to a pH of five,

100
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,610
by a factor of 10.

101
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,671
And so, comparing
something with a pH of four

102
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,819
to a pH of eight, that
thing with the pH of four

103
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,819
would be 10, 100, 1,000,

104
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,934
10,000 times more acidic,

105
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:56,009
or you could say the
thing with a pH of eight

106
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,509
is 10, 100, 1,000,

107
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,822
10,000 times more basic.

108
00:05:02,276 --> 00:05:03,556
So I'll leave you there.

109
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:06,522
Keep a lookout when people
talk about pH balance

110
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:09,183
or blood pH, and we're also, as we study

111
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,134
more and more biology,
we're gonna talk about

112
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:14,365
how pH might influence
some biological reactions

113
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:16,672
and especially once
you get into chemistry,

114
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:20,839
pH will inform us what type of
reaction is likely to happen.
