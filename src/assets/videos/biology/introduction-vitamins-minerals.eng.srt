1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,091
- [Instructor] We've been
told throughout out lives

2
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:06,115
to eat certain foods because
they contain vitamins

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08,436
or sometimes people might
say they also contain

4
00:00:08,436 --> 00:00:10,637
some minerals that you need,

5
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:13,749
and so the obvious question
is, well what are vitamins?

6
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:16,942
And what are these minerals
that folks are talking about?

7
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:19,474
Well the big picture idea is,
that there's certain things

8
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:21,969
that your body needs and
we'll talk in a second

9
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,605
about why your body needs these things,

10
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,516
but also, there are things
that your body needs

11
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:28,535
and your body does not produce them.

12
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:30,369
Body does not produce.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,068
There's a lot of things
your body needs that

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,311
your body is capable of producing
but there's certain things

15
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,941
that it needs that it
cannot produce itself.

16
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:42,058
Now if these things that they need,

17
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:44,334
that the body needs and it cannot produce,

18
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:46,001
if they are organic,

19
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:49,673
and organic is just a very fancy way

20
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:51,439
of saying if there are compounds

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,274
that involve carbons in them,

22
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:56,981
and most molecules in life
involve a lot of carbons,

23
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:59,211
that's why they're
called organic molecules.

24
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,905
There's a whole field of chemistry,

25
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:04,013
of organic chemistry which
is studying the chemistry

26
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,319
of life for the most part.

27
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,273
If these molecules, if these
things that the body needs

28
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:11,262
that it does not produce,
itself are organic,

29
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:13,763
we call these things vitamins.

30
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:18,441
And some of the common vitamins
that you'll hear people

31
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:22,405
talk about are things
like Vitamin A, Vitamin D,

32
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:26,572
Vitamin E, Vitamin K, Vitamin
C, and you can further divide

33
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:31,861
these vitamins based on
whether they are soluble

34
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,367
in fat or not.

35
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:37,486
So, for example, Vitamins A, D, E and K,

36
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:40,885
and this is by no means an
exhaustive list of vitamins,

37
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:43,337
these are fat soluble.

38
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,375
What does that mean?

39
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,044
Well, to be soluble means you could be

40
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:47,146
dissolved in that thing.

41
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:49,108
So it can be dissolved in fat.

42
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,691
And Vitamin C is water soluble.

43
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:57,429
Now the reason why this
might be relevant for you,

44
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,617
living as an individual,
trying to keep your health

45
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:03,054
in good shape, is that you do
need all of these vitamins,

46
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:05,440
and we'll talk in a little
bit about why you need them,

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,038
but fat soluble vitamins,
they're actually easier

48
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,655
to overdose on, because
they're soluble in fat,

49
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,548
they can stay in your system a lot longer,

50
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:15,007
while water soluble vitamins are easier

51
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,532
to flush out of your system.

52
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,270
Now, with that out of the
way, let's think about some

53
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,271
of these common foods you might see,

54
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,989
and some of the vitamins
that they are known for.

55
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,306
For example, right over
here you have carrots,

56
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:28,634
and you might have had people tell you,

57
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:29,573
"Hey, eat carrots.

58
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:31,066
"It's good for your eyes."

59
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,887
And that is true, but the reason why

60
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:33,834
it's good for your eyes,

61
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:38,409
is that carrots contain
something known as betacarotene,

62
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,534
and the carotene part of
betacarotene is not a coincidence.

63
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:45,156
It literally comes from Latin for carrot,

64
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,754
and carotenes are these pigment molecules.

65
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:50,489
It gives the carrot this
orange color right over here,

66
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,826
and betacarotene, once
it's consumed by your body,

67
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:56,409
it's a precursor for Vitamin A,

68
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,583
which is essential for your eyes

69
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:02,021
and many, many other things in your body.

70
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,517
And a precursor's just a
very fancy way of saying

71
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,263
that if you consume
betacarotene, you're body can

72
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:11,690
turn it into the Vitamin A that it needs.

73
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,108
Oranges, famous for
Vitamin C, and this isn't

74
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,921
an exhaustive list of things
that these foods contain,

75
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,537
but this is some of the things
that they're most famous for,

76
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:24,330
and Vitamin C as we talked about
is a water soluble vitamin.

77
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,878
It's very valuable for immune system,

78
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,590
and in a situation where
you have a severe deficiency

79
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:34,430
of Vitamin C, you could get
a disease known as scurvy.

80
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,148
And scurvy is not too common
anymore, but several hundred

81
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:40,019
years ago, sailors would
often get scurvy because

82
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,483
they had very limited diets.

83
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,470
They did not get fruits and vegetables,

84
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,792
and because of that Vitamin C deficiency,

85
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,412
their collagen, their connective
tissue would break down.

86
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:52,841
So it was a very horrible
and painful disease.

87
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,472
But what if there's
something your body needs

88
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:57,220
that it does not produce
that is not organic?

89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,508
Well those are the things
that we call minerals.

90
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,392
And, of course, the term
minerals, it's also used

91
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,399
in a geological sense, but
if were talking in terms

92
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,426
of biology, that's what we mean.

93
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:10,977
And most of the typical
minerals are really elements

94
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:13,660
that you will see on the periodic table.

95
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,302
They will be things like phosphorous,

96
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:19,023
and I'm just gonna write
their element symbol.

97
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:23,106
Phosphorous, calcium,
potassium, magnesium, iron,

98
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,987
and again, this is not an exhaustive list,

99
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,886
but these are all essential for your body.

100
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:33,776
As we go further in our study of biology,

101
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:36,207
you will see how phosphorous is useful

102
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,658
in molecules like ATP, the energy store.

103
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:43,829
It's even in the backbone of DNA and RNA.

104
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,836
We'll see how calcium is
useful, not just for your bones,

105
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:50,365
but even for things like
muscle contractions.

106
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:53,308
To send signals down
neurons, you're going to need

107
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:55,598
your potassium and also sodium.

108
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:59,257
Magnesium, also important
for muscle contraction.

109
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,840
Iron, this is in your
hemoglobin, bonds to the oxygen,

110
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,429
allows you to transport
oxygen in your bloodstream

111
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,875
and red blood cells.

112
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,001
So these are all very valuable.

113
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,126
And a lot of those foods
that we just talked about

114
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,400
that contain vitamins,
they'll also contain minerals.

115
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,969
For example, not only do
carrots contain betacarotene,

116
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,627
they also contain potassium,
which we mentioned

117
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:27,079
is essential for things
like nerve function.

118
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,340
Things like milk, it has
vitamins, like Vitamin D,

119
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,287
but it also has minerals like calcium,

120
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:35,581
which we talked about as
essential for your bones

121
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,729
and for muscle function.

122
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,200
And so the big picture here is,

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,760
is that vitamins and
minerals are both things

124
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:44,661
that your body needs, that
it does not produce itself,

125
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,245
and we're going to see them
over and over again in biology.

126
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:48,887
So keep a lookout for them.

127
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:51,394
The vitamins as we go further
in our study of biology,

128
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,494
we're going to see them as co-enzymes,

129
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:56,330
things that help facilitate
functions of the cell,

130
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,825
help facilitate reactions and the minerals

131
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,442
you're going to see in
everything from the powerhouse

132
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,949
of the cell, the backbone of DNA,

133
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,936
you're going to see it
in muscle contraction

134
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:07,183
and how bones are formed.

135
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:08,787
You're gonna see it in hemoglobin.

136
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:10,609
You're gonna see it in nerve function.
